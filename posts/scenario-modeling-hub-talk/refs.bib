  abstract     = {Differences in infectious disease risk, acquisition, and severity arise from intersectional systems of oppression and resulting historical injustices that shape individual behavior and circumstance. We define historical injustices as distinct events and policies that arise out of intersectional systems of oppression. We view historical injustices as a medium through which structural forces affect health both directly and indirectly, and are thus important to study in the context of infectious disease disparities. In this critical analysis we aim to highlight the importance of incorporating historical injustices into mathematical models of infectious disease transmission and provide context on the methodologies to do so. We offer two illustrations of elements of model building (i.e., parameterization, calibration and validation) that can allow for a better understanding of health disparities in infectious disease outcomes. Mathematical models that do not recognize the historical forces that underlie infectious disease dynamics inevitably lead to the individualization of our focus and the recommendation of untenable individual-behavioral prescriptions to address the burden of infectious disease.},

  abstract     = {There have been over 100 years of literature discussing the deleterious influence of racism on health. Much of the literature describes racism as a driver of social determinants of health, such as housing, employment, income, and education. More recently, increased attention has been given to measuring the structural nature of a system that advantages one racialized group over others rather than solely relying on individual acknowledgement of racism. Despite these advances, there is still a need for methodological and analytical approaches to complement the aforementioned. This commentary calls on epidemiologists and other health researchers at large to engage the discourse on measuring structural racism. First, we address the conflation between race and racism in epidemiologic research. Next, we offer methodological recommendations (linking of interdisciplinary variables and data sets and leveraging mixed-method and life-course approaches) and analytical recommendations (integration of mixed data, use of multidimensional models) that epidemiologists and other health researchers may consider in health equity research. The goal of this commentary is to inspire the use of up-to-date and theoretically driven approaches to increase discourse among public health researchers on capturing racism as well as to improve evidence of its role as the fundamental cause of racial health inequities.},

  abstract     = {Background: The impact of variable infection risk by race and ethnicity on the dynamics of SARS CoV-2 spread is largely unknown. Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk changes across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81\% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34\% of non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  abstract     = {Mathematical models have come to play a key role in global pandemic preparedness and outbreak response: helping to plan for disease burden, hospital capacity, and inform nonpharmaceutical interventions. Such models have played a pivotal role in the COVID-19 pandemic, with transmission models—and, by consequence, modelers—guiding global, national, and local responses to SARS-CoV-2. However, these models have largely not accounted for the social and structural factors, which lead to socioeconomic, racial, and geographic health disparities. In this piece, we raise and attempt to clarify several questions relating to this important gap in the research and practice of infectious disease modeling: Why do epidemiologic models of emerging infections typically ignore known structural drivers of disparate health outcomes? What have been the consequences of a framework focused primarily on aggregate outcomes on infection equity? What should be done to develop a more holistic approach to modeling-based decision-making during pandemics? In this review, we evaluate potential historical and political explanations for the exclusion of drivers of disparity in infectious disease models for emerging infections, which have often been characterized as “equal opportunity infectors” despite ample evidence to the contrary. We look to examples from other disease systems (HIV, STIs) and successes in including social inequity in models of acute infection transmission as a blueprint for how social connections, environmental, and structural factors can be integrated into a coherent, rigorous, and interpretable modeling framework. We conclude by outlining principles to guide modeling of emerging infections in ways that represent the causes of inequity in infection as central rather than peripheral mechanisms.},

We propose a conceptual framework to facilitate more rigorous examination and testing of hypothesized mechanisms through which social and environmental factors shape the burden of infectious diseases and lead to persistent inequities. Drawing upon the principles laid out by Link and Phelan in their landmark paper on social conditions, we offer an explication of potential pathways through which structural disadvantage (e.g., racism, sexism, and economic deprivation) operates to produce infectious disease inequities. Specifically, we describe how the social environment impacts an individual’s risk of infectious disease through 1) increasing exposure to infectious pathogens; and 2) increasing susceptibility to infection. This framework will facilitate both the systematic examination of the ways in which structural disadvantage shapes the burden of infectious disease and the design of interventions that can disrupt these pathways.},

  abstract   = {Characterizing the cumulative burden of COVID-19 by race/ethnicity is of the utmost importance for public health researchers and policy makers in order to design effective mitigation measures. This analysis is hampered, however, by surveillance case data with substantial missingness in race and ethnicity covariates. Worse yet, this missingness likely depends on the values of these missing covariates, i.e. they are not missing at random (NMAR). We propose a Bayesian parametric model that leverages joint information on spatial variation in the disease and covariate missingness processes and can accommodate both MAR and NMAR missingness. We show that the model is locally identifiable when the spatial distribution of the population covariates is known and observed cases can be associated with a spatial unit of observation. We also use a simulation study to investigate the model's finite-sample performance. We compare our model's performance on NMAR data against complete-case analysis and multiple imputation (MI), both of which are commonly used by public health researchers when confronted with missing categorical covariates. Finally, we model spatial variation in cumulative COVID-19 incidence in Wayne County, Michigan using data from the Michigan Department and Health and Human Services. The analysis suggests that population relative risk estimates by race during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan were understated for non-white residents compared to white residents when cases missing race were dropped or had these values imputed using MI.},

Here we model the effect of evictions on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, simulating viral transmission within and among households in a theoretical metropolitan area. We recreate a range of urban epidemic trajectories and project the course of the epidemic under two counterfactual scenarios, one in which a strict moratorium on evictions is in place and enforced, and another in which evictions are allowed to resume at baseline or increased rates. We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods. Our results provide a basis to assess eviction moratoria and show that policies to stem evictions are a warranted and important component of COVID-19 control.},

  abstract     = {Several empirical studies have documented the eects of residential segregation on health inequalities between the US African±American and white populations. However, the majority of such studies have not explained the pathways that link residential segregation and speci®c health outcomes. This paper presents a conceptual framework of the role that residential segregation may play in the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) and other infectious diseases. This is an important issue given the concentration of TB cases among US racial/ethnic minorities and the increasing gap in the incidence of infectious diseases between minorities and the white majority. Segregation may have an indirect eect on the transmission of TB because of its negative impact on the quality of neighborhood environment in segregated communities. Segregation concentrates poverty, overcrowded and dilapidated housing and social disintegration in minority areas, and results in limited access to health care. Furthermore, two dimensions of residential segregation (isolation and concentration) may have direct eects on TB transmission. The isolation of minorities con®nes TB to segregated areas and prevents transmission to the rest of the population. High-density levels in minority areas increase the probability of transmission within the segregated group. In order to operationalize the above pathways, health researchers may rely on the segregation literature, which has conceptualized various dimensions of residential segregation and proposed ways to measure them. The indirect pathways that link segregation and TB can be captured through exposure indices, which quantify the concentration of risk factors for TB for various racial and ethnic groups. The direct pathways can be captured through the isolation index (which is a proxy for the degree of interaction between the segregated group and the rest of the population) and two proposed measures of density (which are proxies for the likelihood of transmission within the segregated group and from the segregated group to the rest of the population). 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
