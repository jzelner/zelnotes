    "text": "Spatial Epidemiology is All About Relationships\nThe focus of this class session will be on understanding the concept of spatial autocorrelation and variation and what they means for epidemiological analysis. Where variation is large, we should expect to see big differences from place to place.\nAutocorrelation is about how that variation plays out over space: Where there is strong spatial autocorrelation, things that are close to each other are far more likely to be similar than things that are far away from each other. But one can have strong autocorrelation and low variation, high variation and no autocorrelation, and on and on…\nWe will spend this class session trying to make sense of this concept in qualitative terms, first by discussing a pair of articles that nicely lay out the key ideas here, and then by doing a hands-on activity focused on visualizing patterns of spatial variation and autocorrelation using a spatial smoothing approach.\n\nBefore Class\nPlease read the following two pieces that discuss key ideas about geospatial relatedness:\nMiller HJ. Tobler’s First Law and Spatial Analysis. Annals of the Association of American Geographers. 2004;94(2):284-289. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09402005.x\nGoodchild MF.

    "text": "I believe strongly that this course is a collaborative endeavor, and that the primary objective of this class is to help you clarify and achieve your own academic and professional goals. Our course policies are developed with that in mind and with the goal of creating an environment of mutual respect that also fosters intellectual exploration, creativity and productive risk-taking. If at any point you feel that these goals are not being met, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.\n\n\nThis class will be held in-person and students are asked and expected to attend in-person whenever possible. If you do need to miss class for whatever reason, please let me know ahead of time so that we can plan accordingly.\nI will record each class session using Zoom and make the link to these recordings available to the entire class. When we have a guest speaker, these sessions will be recorded if the visiting speaker consents.\nIf you are unable to attend in person but can join via Zoom, that will be an option. However, since the class is heavily focused on discussion, in-class activities, and project work, the utility of these recordings and remote participation will be limited primarily to listening to and reviewing the lecture portions of the class.\n\n\n\nDue dates for assignments have been chosen to ensure that there is enough time to give detailed feedback prior to the due date for the next assignment. However, I know that life often intervenes in the form of either personal obligations or other assignments which can make it difficult to get every assignment in on time. If you do not anticipate being able to make a due date, please let me know as far ahead of time as possible so that we can arrange an extension.\n\n\n\nI believe that detailed, qualitative feedback from instructors and peers is far more useful than numerical grading. Numerical grading schemes disincentivize exploration and risk-taking, rewarding consistency over the course of a term over growth. Assignment assessments and final grades for this course are constructed with the goal of facilitating growth and exploration within a student-centered environment. This, of course, entails a slightly different set of expectations and responsibilities for students and instructors than in a course following a classic grading/assessment scheme.\n\n\n\nThere will be no numerical or letter grades given for written assignments or presentations, including the final product of your semester-long project. Instead, you will receive written feedback from me on each assignment, and will also have a number of opportunities to share your ideas and receive constructive feedback from your classmates.\nThis will include in-class presentations on your research topic, structured peer-reviews of work-in-progress, in-class ‘workshop’ time to work with your project group and get advice from me and your classmates, as well as periodic self-assessments that you will submit to me.\nFollowing fall break, I will ask you to submit responses to a midterm check-in survey, which will allow me to better understand what is working and not working for you in the class so that we can make adjustments for the second half of the term.\n\n[!NOTE] For peer and self-assessments, I will provide a template containing an outline of the areas I am asking you to give feedback on. These assessment opportunities are meant to help keep you on track and to flag individual and collective issues (i.e. unclear assignment instructions, questions about assignment topics, format, etc. as they arise).\n\n\n\n\nFinal course grades will be self-assigned and based on each student’s assessment of their progress towards their self-identified goals as well as those identified by me over the course of the term. I reserve the right to revise final grades upwards or downwards if necessary, but will only do this only in rare cases where a student’s self-assessed grade is strongly out of alignment with my perception of their performance in the course, and in all others will take the student’s self-assessed grade as-is.\n\n[!IMPORTANT] The primary factors that would result in a downward revision of a student’s self-assessed grade are 1) chronic, unexplained lateness in turning in assignments or not completing assignments, 2) instances of academic dishonesty.\n\nWhile consistent in-person attendance is expected, I understand that personal, professional and academic circumstances may periodically impact your ability to attend either in-person or remotely. I will not take attendance during regular course sessions and an excused absence is not required on most days.\n\n[!WARNING] However, on days when students are presenting and giving/receiving feedback, attendance or an excused absence is required and unexplained/excused absence may result in a downward revision of your final grade. This requirement reflects a recognition that on these days of class, individual attendance impacts all course members.\n\nStudents are also welcome to take the course under the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading scheme offered by SPH if desired."

This could be reducing incidence of a particular disease in a community, increasing knowledge of risk and protective factors among at-risk individuals, or closing a gap in scientific knowledge of the problem, or something else you identify as being important.\nIn other words, I am asking you to identify a concrete target for improvement in your problem. This could be quantitative, e.g. a 10% reduction in risk of death from cardiovascular disease in a given community, or something more qualitative. For example, if your identified problem is around a knowledge or data gap rather than reducing disease incidence, it could be focused on developing a scientific study or evaluation project to understand the mechanisms driving your outcome.\nThis assignment will take the form of an in-class presentation prior to the mid-term break in late February in which you will outline the problem and argue for its importance based on your work in the “What is the origin” project and feedback from me on this work, and then present your target for improvement based on your research and understanding of what has already been tried in this area."

The purpose of this assignment is for you to build a useful reference for yourself that can inform work on your project going forward. Over the course of the term, you will build this reference to form a coherent plan for your final product.\nThink of this as being more like a well-annotated lab notebook or a portfolio than a formal research paper. It should still be well-documented and clearly written, but can include different sources of content including references to academic papers, news articles, video clips, and anything else you think is relevant or important for understanding your topic.\n\nDefining your problem\nYou should define your problem with as much specificity as possible. For example, if you are interested in Tuberculosis (TB), rather than discussing spatial variation of TB infection at a very high level, focus on the problem of TB in a specific city or region.

    "text": "In this brief tutorial, we will review some basic ideas about smoothing and start thinking through how we can express these ideas mathematically and in R.\nTobler’s profound - but deceptively simple - first law states that:\n\n“Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things.” (Tobler 1970)\n\nHe applied this idea to his development of a dynamic model of urban growth in the Detroit region which assumed that rates of population growth were spatially similar:\n\n\nIn this post, we’re going to start with a simpler problem - change in the value of a function in one dimension - to see how we can translate the concept of distance decay implied by Tobler’s first law (TFL) into a useful model. To begin, we’re going to keep it simple with no noise or observation error and just interpolate some values.\n\n\nIn this example, we are interested in visualizing and predicting the values of a function \\(f(x_i)\\) which outputs values \\(y_i\\), the expected value of the output function.\n\\[\ny_i = f(x_i)\n\\]\nLets start by getting the values of \\(f(x)\\) for every input value \\(x\\). For simplicity, we will assume that \\(f(x)\\) is a sine function and that the values of \\(x\\) go from -1 to +5, allowing us to observe one half cycle of the sine function:\n\nx <- seq(-1, 5, by = 0.1)\ny <- sin(x)\nplot(x,y)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see right away that this simple curve pretty neatly expresses Tobler’s first law: \\(f(x)\\) values of each point are in general more similar to each other for nearby values of \\(x\\). If we want to press this idea into real-world practice, we need a model that can translate TFL into quantitative estimates and qualitative visualizations. There are lots of ways to do this, but we’ll focus in on locally-weighted regression, also known LOWESS.\nThe basic idea of a LOWESS regression is to define a window of size \\(k\\) points around each value one wishes to estimate, and calculate a weighted average of the value of those points, which can then be used as the estimated value \\(\\hat{y_j} \\approx f(x_j)\\). We then run the values of these nearest neighbors through a weight function \\(w(x)\\).\nThese weight functions can take a lot of different forms, but we’ll start simple with a uniform one, i.e. just taking the average of the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors, so that \\(\\hat{y} = sum(z(x_i, k))/k\\), where \\(KNNz\\) is a function returning the \\(y\\) values of the k nearest observations to \\(x_i\\). The value of \\(k\\) is sometimes referred to as the bandwidth of the smoothing function: Larger bandwidths use more data to estimate values at each point, smaller ones use less.\n\n\nUsing the fnn package for R, we can find the indices of the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors of each point we want to make an estimate at:\n\nlibrary(FNN)\nk <- 10\nz <- knn.index(x, k=k)\n\nYou can read the output of this function, below, as indicating the indices (\\(i\\)) of the 10 nearest points to each of the values of \\(x\\).\n\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n [1,]    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [2,]    1    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [3,]    2    4    1    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [4,]    5    3    6    2    1    7    8    9   10    11\n [5,]    6    4    7    3    8    2    1    9   10    11\n [6,]    5    7    4    8    3    9    2   10    1    11\n [7,]    8    6    9    5   10    4   11    3   12     2\n [8,]    7    9   10    6   11    5    4   12    3    13\n [9,]   10    8   11    7   12    6    5   13   14     4\n[10,]    9   11    8   12    7   13   14    6    5    15\n\n\nWe can visualize this by picking a point in the middle of the series and its 10 nearest neighbors and the estimated value of \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) obtained by just taking the average of the k nearest points:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## Plot the original data\ng <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\")\n\n## Now, get the index for x = 2\nx_index <- which(x==2)\n\n## Show the range of k nearest neighbors of this point\nknn_low <- min(x[z[x_index, ]])\nknn_high <- max(x[z[x_index, ]])\ny_hat <- mean(y[z[x_index,]], )\n\n## Add errorbars to the figure to show the 10 nearest values with the height of the point indicating the estimated value at y_i, denoted by the red dot\ng <- g + geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = knn_low, xmax = knn_high, y = y_hat)) + geom_point(aes(x=2,y_hat), colour = \"red\")\n\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\nNotice that if the knn function is applied at the low end of the series, i.e. to the first value, it will use points to the right of that one instead of to either side:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## Plot the original data\ng <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\")\n\n## Use the index for the lowest value\nx_index <- 1\n\n## Show the range of k nearest neighbors of this point\nknn_low <- min(x[z[x_index, ]])\nknn_high <- max(x[z[x_index, ]])\ny_hat <- mean(y[z[x_index,]], )\n\n## Add errorbars to the figure to show the 10 nearest values with the height of the point indicating the estimated value at y_i\ng <- g + geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = knn_low, xmax = knn_high, y = y_hat)) + geom_point(aes(x=x[x_index],y_hat), colour = \"red\")\n\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets see what happens if we run our smoother over the whole series and take the average of the 10 nearest points for each and compare them to the observed data:\n\ny_hat <- rep(0, length(x))\nfor (i in 1:length(x) ) {\n  y_hat[i] <- mean(y[z[i,]], )\n}\n\nNow plot the prediucted vs. the observed values:\n\ng <- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\") + geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y_hat), colour = \"red\")\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\nYou can see this does a pretty good job all the way through, except at the edges. Lets try it again with a smaller window - or bandwidth - of 5 and see what happens. First, we’ll write a function that will give us the predicted value of y at each point given a window of size k and an input value:\n\nknn_est <- function(x, y, k) {\n  z <- knn.index(x, k=k)\n  y_hat <- rep(0, length(x))\n  \nfor (i in 1:length(x) ) {\n  y_hat[i] <- mean(y[z[i,]], )\n}\n\n  df <- data.frame(x=x, y = y, yhat = y_hat)\n  return(df)\n}\n\n\npred_df <- knn_est(x, y, 5)\ng <- ggplot(pred_df) + geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_line(aes(x=x,y=yhat),colour=\"red\")\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\nThis gets rid of a lot of the weird effects at the edges but introduces some noise into the function. What if we make the window bigger, say 20, to get rid of some of the noise?\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to make the edge effects worse, as well as the estimates of the function overall worse.\nWhat happens if we go in the opposite direction and shrink the window down to 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this appear to be more accurate for these data than \\(k=10\\) and \\(k=5\\)?\nWhat would happen if we added observation noise to the values of \\(y_i\\)? Which one of the smoothers do you think would work better then?\nIs the one best value of \\(k\\) for all datasets? How might you go about picking the best one?\nHow does our uniform weight function express Tobler’s first law? What kind of weight function \\(w(x)\\) might do a better job of capturing the notion of distance decay?"
