To make these match the radon dataset, we can use some tools from the stringr package as well as some base R functions:\n\nminnesota &lt;-\n  minnesota %&gt;% mutate(\n    ## Since all of the original county names have the same substring \" County, Minnesota\"\n    ## we can use the str_remove function to pull them out of all of them\n    county = str_remove(NAME, \" County, Minnesota\") %&gt;% \n      ## Since some of the counties  officially have two-word names (e.g. Big Stone)\n      ## which are collapsed in the radon dataset, we will use this function to remove all spaces:\n      str_replace_all(\" \", \"\") %&gt;% \n      ## A few county names include abbreviations indicated by the presence of a '.' (e.g. St. Louis)\n      ## so we will get rid of that bit of punctuation since it is not in the original data\n      str_replace_all(\"\\\\.\", \"\") %&gt;% \n      ## Finally, convert all the county names to uppercase\n      toupper()\n  )\n\nNow, the county labels should match:\n\nhead(sort(minnesota$county))\n\n[1] \"AITKIN\"   \"ANOKA\"    \"BECKER\"   \"BELTRAMI\" \"BENTON\"   \"BIGSTONE\""

The function below lets us do that:\nThe figure below shows the true value of our density function \\(f(x)\\) in red, the density of points in the simulated data along the x-axis of the ‘rug plot’, and our smoothed density in black, for a bandwidth of \\(h=10\\):\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\npred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = 10)\n\ng &lt;- ggplot() + geom_rug(aes(x=x)) + \ngeom_line(data = pred_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + \nylab(\"Density\") + geom_line(data = dens_df, aes(x=x,y=y), colour=\"red\") + \nxlim(0, 1000)\ndens_ojs &lt;- dens_df\ndens_ojs$y &lt;- dens_ojs$y*cc\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets see what happens if we try this for different values of \\(h\\):\n\n\nCode\nall_df &lt;- data.frame()\nfor (hv in c(5, 10, 20, 50 ,100, 250)) {\n  pred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = hv)\n  pred_df$h &lt;- hv\n  all_df &lt;- rbind(all_df, pred_df) \n}\n\n  all_df$h &lt;- as.factor(all_df$h)\n\ng &lt;- ggplot(all_df) + geom_rug(aes(x=x)) + \ngeom_line(data = dens_df, aes(x=x,y=y), colour=\"red\") + \ngeom_line(aes(x=x, y=y)) + \nylab(\"Density\") + \nfacet_wrap(~ h) +\nxlim(0, 1000)\n\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nall_df &lt;- data.frame()\nhvals &lt;- seq(1, 100, by = 2)\ndistvals &lt;- seq(-100, 100, by = 1)\nall_kernvals &lt;- data.frame()\nfor (hv in hvals) {\n  pred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = hv)\n  pred_df$h &lt;- hv\n  pred_df$smoother &lt;- \"gaussian\"\n  all_df &lt;- rbind(all_df, pred_df) \n  all_kernvals &lt;- rbind(all_kernvals,data.frame(x=distvals, y=kdgaussian(distvals, bw = hv), smoother = \"gaussian\", h = hv))\n  \n  pred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = hv, kern = kduniform, kernp=kpuniform)\n  pred_df$h &lt;- hv\n  pred_df$smoother &lt;- \"uniform\"\n  all_df &lt;- rbind(all_df, pred_df) \n  all_kernvals &lt;- rbind(all_kernvals,data.frame(x=distvals, y=kduniform(distvals, bw = hv), smoother = \"uniform\", h = hv))\n\n  \n  pred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = hv, kern = kdtricube, kernp=kptricube)\n  pred_df$h &lt;- hv\n  pred_df$smoother &lt;- \"tricube\"\n  all_df &lt;- rbind(all_df, pred_df) \n    all_kernvals &lt;- rbind(all_kernvals, data.frame(x=distvals, y=kdtricube(distvals, bw = hv), smoother = \"tricube\", h = hv))\n    \n  pred_df &lt;- normal_smoother(x, h = hv, kern = kdtriangular, kernp=kptriangular)\n  pred_df$h &lt;- hv\n  pred_df$smoother &lt;- \"triangular\"\n  all_df &lt;- rbind(all_df, pred_df) \n    all_kernvals &lt;- rbind(all_kernvals, data.frame(x=distvals, y=kdtriangular(distvals, bw = hv), smoother = \"triangular\", h = hv))\n\n}\nall_df$y &lt;- all_df$y * cc"

    "text": "In this brief tutorial, we will review some basic ideas about smoothing and start thinking through how we can express these ideas mathematically and in R.\nTobler’s profound - but deceptively simple - first law states that:\n\n“Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things.” (Tobler 1970)\n\nHe applied this idea to his development of a dynamic model of urban growth in the Detroit region which assumed that rates of population growth were spatially similar:\n\n\nIn this post, we’re going to start with a simpler problem - change in the value of a function in one dimension - to see how we can translate the concept of distance decay implied by Tobler’s first law (TFL) into a useful model. To begin, we’re going to keep it simple with no noise or observation error and just interpolate some values.\n\n\nIn this example, we are interested in visualizing and predicting the values of a function \\(f(x_i)\\) which outputs values \\(y_i\\), the expected value of the output function.\n\\[\ny_i = f(x_i)\n\\]\nLets start by getting the values of \\(f(x)\\) for every input value \\(x\\). For simplicity, we will assume that \\(f(x)\\) is a sine function and that the values of \\(x\\) go from -1 to +5, allowing us to observe one half cycle of the sine function:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-1, 5, by = 0.1)\ny &lt;- sin(x)\nplot(x,y)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see right away that this simple curve pretty neatly expresses Tobler’s first law: \\(f(x)\\) values of each point are in general more similar to each other for nearby values of \\(x\\). If we want to press this idea into real-world practice, we need a model that can translate TFL into quantitative estimates and qualitative visualizations. There are lots of ways to do this, but we’ll focus in on locally-weighted regression, also known LOWESS.\nThe basic idea of a LOWESS regression is to define a window of size \\(k\\) points around each value one wishes to estimate, and calculate a weighted average of the value of those points, which can then be used as the estimated value \\(\\hat{y_j} \\approx f(x_j)\\). We then run the values of these nearest neighbors through a weight function \\(w(x)\\).\nThese weight functions can take a lot of different forms, but we’ll start simple with a uniform one, i.e. just taking the average of the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors, so that \\(\\hat{y} = sum(z(x_i, k))/k\\), where \\(KNNz\\) is a function returning the \\(y\\) values of the k nearest observations to \\(x_i\\). The value of \\(k\\) is sometimes referred to as the bandwidth of the smoothing function: Larger bandwidths use more data to estimate values at each point, smaller ones use less.\n\n\nUsing the fnn package for R, we can find the indices of the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors of each point we want to make an estimate at:\n\nlibrary(FNN)\nk &lt;- 10\nz &lt;- knn.index(x, k=k)\n\nYou can read the output of this function, below, as indicating the indices (\\(i\\)) of the 10 nearest points to each of the values of \\(x\\).\n\n\n      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]\n [1,]    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [2,]    1    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [3,]    2    4    1    5    6    7    8    9   10    11\n [4,]    5    3    6    2    1    7    8    9   10    11\n [5,]    6    4    7    3    8    2    1    9   10    11\n [6,]    5    7    4    8    3    9    2   10    1    11\n [7,]    8    6    9    5   10    4   11    3   12     2\n [8,]    7    9   10    6   11    5    4   12    3    13\n [9,]   10    8   11    7   12    6    5   13   14     4\n[10,]    9   11    8   12    7   13   14    6    5    15\n\n\nWe can visualize this by picking a point in the middle of the series and its 10 nearest neighbors and the estimated value of \\(\\hat{y_i}\\) obtained by just taking the average of the k nearest points:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## Plot the original data\ng &lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\")\n\n## Now, get the index for x = 2\nx_index &lt;- which(x==2)\n\n## Show the range of k nearest neighbors of this point\nknn_low &lt;- min(x[z[x_index, ]])\nknn_high &lt;- max(x[z[x_index, ]])\ny_hat &lt;- mean(y[z[x_index,]], )\n\n## Add errorbars to the figure to show the 10 nearest values with the height of the point indicating the estimated value at y_i, denoted by the red dot\ng &lt;- g + geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = knn_low, xmax = knn_high, y = y_hat)) + geom_point(aes(x=2,y_hat), colour = \"red\")\n\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that if the knn function is applied at the low end of the series, i.e. to the first value, it will use points to the right of that one instead of to either side:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n## Plot the original data\ng &lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\")\n\n## Use the index for the lowest value\nx_index &lt;- 1\n\n## Show the range of k nearest neighbors of this point\nknn_low &lt;- min(x[z[x_index, ]])\nknn_high &lt;- max(x[z[x_index, ]])\ny_hat &lt;- mean(y[z[x_index,]], )\n\n## Add errorbars to the figure to show the 10 nearest values with the height of the point indicating the estimated value at y_i\ng &lt;- g + geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = knn_low, xmax = knn_high, y = y_hat)) + geom_point(aes(x=x[x_index],y_hat), colour = \"red\")\n\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, lets see what happens if we run our smoother over the whole series and take the average of the 10 nearest points for each and compare them to the observed data:\n\ny_hat &lt;- rep(0, length(x))\nfor (i in 1:length(x) ) {\n  y_hat[i] &lt;- mean(y[z[i,]], )\n}\n\nNow plot the predicted vs. the observed values:\n\ng &lt;- ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=x, y = y)) + \n  xlab(\"x\") + ylab(\"f(x)\") + geom_line(aes(x=x, y=y_hat), colour = \"red\")\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see this does a pretty good job all the way through, except at the edges. Lets try it again with a smaller window - or bandwidth - of 5 and see what happens. First, we’ll write a function that will give us the predicted value of y at each point given a window of size k and an input value:\n\nknn_est &lt;- function(x, y, k) {\n  z &lt;- knn.index(x, k=k)\n  y_hat &lt;- rep(0, length(x))\n  \nfor (i in 1:length(x) ) {\n  y_hat[i] &lt;- mean(y[z[i,]], )\n}\n\n  df &lt;- data.frame(x=x, y = y, yhat = y_hat)\n  return(df)\n}\n\n\npred_df &lt;- knn_est(x, y, 5)\ng &lt;- ggplot(pred_df) + geom_point(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_line(aes(x=x,y=yhat),colour=\"red\")\nplot(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gets rid of a lot of the weird effects at the edges but introduces some noise into the function. What if we make the window bigger, say 20, to get rid of some of the noise?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis seems to make the edge effects worse, as well as the estimates of the function overall worse.\nWhat happens if we go in the opposite direction and shrink the window down to 2?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does this appear to be more accurate for these data than \\(k=10\\) and \\(k=5\\)?\nWhat would happen if we added observation noise to the values of \\(y_i\\)? Which one of the smoothers do you think would work better then?\nIs the one best value of \\(k\\) for all datasets? How might you go about picking the best one?\nHow does our uniform weight function express Tobler’s first law? What kind of weight function \\(w(x)\\) might do a better job of capturing the notion of distance decay?"

Which one of the smoothers do you think would work better then?\nIs the one best value of \\(k\\) for all datasets? How might you go about picking the best one?\nHow does our uniform weight function express Tobler’s first law? What kind of weight function \\(w(x)\\) might do a better job of capturing the notion of distance decay?"

    "title": "An invitation to spatial epidemiology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One theme that comes up consistently when I’m teaching and talking to students and others about spatial epidemiology is that it is an aura of inaccessibility. This makes a certain kind of sense: Making maps and measuring and modeling spatial relationships might seem like it is outside of the classic analytic toolkit of working epidemiologists, not to mention other fields in public health, medicine, and the social sciences. In fact, this was my take on it as well, until I realized space has always been at the heart of my research, even when I didn’t realize it!\nThe diagram in Figure 1 reflects my interpretation of the way someone coming to this area of research and practice for the first time might see it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart \n  A(Decide to do spatial epidemiology) --&gt; G(Collect spatial data)\n  G --&gt; D(Measure clustering and other spatial descriptives)\n  G --&gt; F(Make descriptive maps)\n  D --&gt; C\n  F --&gt; C(Formulate spatial hypotheses)\n  C --&gt; H(Construct hierarchical models)\n  H --&gt; J(Design and target intervention)\n  J --&gt; K(Evaluate)\n  K --&gt; G\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A textbook version of the spatial epidemiology workflow, without all the twists and turns that characterize actual research.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this view, spatial epidemiology or analysis is taken to be a set of relatively fixed and well-described ideas and procedures connected to a highly technical set of methods. When we come from this perspective, starting a spatial project requires us to embark with a backpack that is already filled with specialized spatial tools.\n\n\nMy goal in this short essay is to chip away a bit at the idea of spatial epidemiology as something separate and apart from mainstream epidemiology and health. Instead, I argue that it is better understood as an emergent phenomenon that acts as a loose wrapper around a core set of ideas and tools that are part of the working arsenal of most professionals, students, and researchers in public health.\nTo explain what I mean, and why I think it’s important, I’m going to subject you to a bit of autobiography about my own intellectual and professional trajectory."

    "title": "An invitation to spatial epidemiology",
    "section": "A process of progressive revelation",
    "text": "A process of progressive revelation\nAs a postdoc, working with Ted Cohen, I began analyzing data from a large study of household-level tuberculosis transmission in Lima, Peru. Figure 3 illustrates the model we developed to characterize household-level differences in transmission rates as a function of exposure type:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Characterizing household-level variation in risks of infection from community vs. household exposures (Figure from Zelner et al. (2014))\n\n\n\nAt the time, I knew that these households were distributed across neighborhoods of Lima, but I didn’t give it much thought. I was more interested in risks experienced by an average household. And to be honest, I didn’t know that spatial metadata were available on each of the households, since I wasn’t involved with the data collection!\nIn the interim, I got the chance to work on some collaborative projects with an explicitly spatial focus. In one, we reconstructed an outbreak of morbillivirus (think: measles) among a herd of migratory dolphins (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Locations of dolphin strandings during a morbillivirus outbreak in the North Atlantic (dot size indicates a greater number of strandings; Figure from Morris et al. (2015))\n\n\n\nIn another, we looked at the relationship between environmental risks, such as neighborhood-level flooding, on the rate of pediatric diarrheal disease in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Incidence of pediatric diarrhea across neighborhoods of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (Figure from Thompson et al. (2015))\n\n\n\nThese were the first experiences I had explicitly looking at these outcomes as a function of geographic space. While I had previously thought that mapping and spatial analysis and health geography were big scary things I couldn’t do, I started to realize something important: These projects were not substantively very distinct from ones I had done before. The difference was that we were explicitly talking about spatial relationships and making maps (or simple one-dimensional diagrams as in Figure 4), instead of implicitly as in Figure 2 or Figure 3.\nAfter completing these other projects, I dove back in to the Lima TB data to look at the drivers of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) risk. This was when I finally found out (some 2 years after I had started working with these data!) that spatial information on each household was available. So, with great trepidation, for the first time I made a map to explore spatial variability in MDR-TB outcomes.\nAnd when I did this, we instantly saw that there were seemingly meaningful differences in the rate of TB overall, and MDR-TB in particular, across different health center catchment areas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The first map(s) I ever made, from Zelner et al. (2016), nearly 10 years after I started my research career.\n\n\n\nThis was the moment, some 10 years after I dipped my toes into the world of infectious disease epidemiology, where I realized I had been doing spatial work all along.\n\nSo what?\nWhy am I bothering you with this tedious and indulgent bit of personal history? It’s because it took me way too long to recognize that spatial epidemiology was a wrapper around a set of skills and ideas I had been working with for many years before I recognized what I was doing. I was intimidated by anything preceded by ‘spatial-’: it sounded like a bunch of skills I didn’t have and couldn’t acquire.\nBut my belated realization about the emergent quality of spatial epidemiology has been really important and helpful for me. It made me realize that when I push into new areas - in life as much as research - that I probably have more of the tools I need than I realized in advance.\nThis means that you don’t need to identify as a spatial analyst to be one. And if you want to think of yourself as one, you should, because ultimately it is the intention to engage with spatial relationships and geographic variation in a meaningful way that makes you a health geographer or spatial epidemiologist. This is likely true for many if not most scientific subfields1, but this one is mine and I’m glad I finally realized it!"

Specifically, we will look at how this particular outbreak was shaped by the confluence of biological, social, and environmental mechanisms.\nAnother important component of this story is one of problem definition: Is the problem transmission of an infectious pathogen, or the spatial aggregation of foul-smelling, disease-causing air?\nDuring this module, we will use Snow’s challenges in convincing a skeptical public and medical establishment of the infectious etiology of Cholera as a springboard for the type of problem definition that is the focus of the Postcards from the Road assignment.

    "text": "A brief (and incomplete!) annotated bibliography of resources on modeling acute infection inequities\n\nStructural Racism and Infection\n\n(Adkins-Jackson et al. 2021) provides a very useful guide for thinking about how epidemiological models and modelers should account for the impacts of racism on disease outcomes. This piece has specific recommendations for analysts around model construction and accounting for multiple, intersecting identities.\n(Noppert, Hegde, and Kubale 2022) articulate a framework based on fundamental cause theory for accounting for and addressing inequities in infection risk. (Zelner, Naraharisetti, and Zelner 2023) is an invited commentary that builds on some of the ideas in the original piece.\n(Chowkwanyun and Reed 2020) is an excellent piece from early in the COVID-19 pandemic which highlights many of the challenges and pitfalls associated with a focus on racial health disparities without adequate attention to their material causes.\n\n\n\nModeling for Equity\n\n(Zelner et al. 2022) and (Abuelezam et al. 2023) attempt to articulate frameworks for doing a better job of using epidemic models to capture the dynamics of inequity in infection and disease outcomes.\n(Ma et al. 2021) is an excellent data-driven exercise in modeling the linkages between race/ethnicity, essential work and inequity in disease outcomes.\n(Nande et al. 2021) is a data-informed simulation model of the potential impact of ending the CDC eviction moratorium on population-wide infection risks and group-specific disparities.\nThis is a hands-on example we put together that translates the framework in (Acevedo-Garcia 2000) into a simple dynamic model of the relationship between residential segregation and infection.\n\n\n\nMethodological challenges\n\n(Zelner et al. 2020) is an analysis examining the relative impacts of case-fatality vs. incidence of infection in inequities in COVID-19 mortality in Michigan.\n(Trangucci, Chen, and Zelner 2022) presents a computationally efficient Bayesian method for accounting for non-random missingness of race-ethnicity data without making restrictive assumptions and/or using surname coding.\nThis is a hands-on comparison of different metrics of spatial segregation applied to the same simulated dataset.\n\n(If you’d like a bibtex file w/these resources, you can find it here)"

The purpose of this assignment is for you to build a useful reference for yourself that can inform work on your project going forward. Over the course of the term, you will build this reference to form a coherent plan for your final product.\nThink of this as being more like a well-annotated lab notebook or a portfolio than a formal research paper. It should still be well-documented and clearly written, but can include different sources of content including references to academic papers, news articles, video clips, and anything else you think is relevant or important for understanding your topic.\n\nDefining your problem\nYou should define your problem with as much specificity as possible. For example, if you are interested in Tuberculosis (TB), rather than discussing spatial variation of TB infection at a very high level, focus on the problem of TB in a specific city or region. Making things concrete will be key for keeping your project focused and making it useful and interesting to you."

This could be reducing incidence of a particular disease in a community, increasing knowledge of risk and protective factors among at-risk individuals, or closing a gap in scientific knowledge of the problem, or something else you identify as being important.\nIn other words, I am asking you to identify a concrete target for improvement in your problem. This could be quantitative, e.g. a 10% reduction in risk of death from cardiovascular disease in a given community, or something more qualitative. For example, if your identified problem is around a knowledge or data gap rather than reducing disease incidence, it could be focused on developing a scientific study or evaluation project to understand the mechanisms driving your outcome. Please think broadly about what the nature of the improvement you wish to make is and connect that to the format of your final project.\nThis assignment will take the form of an in-class ‘lightning’ presentation of 8-10m in mid-Feburary. in your presentation, please briefly:\n\nOutline the problem and argue for its importance,\nPresent your target 🎯 for improvement based on your research and understanding of what has already been tried in this area.\nPropose a format for your final product that will facilitate making progress towards your identified target. This could be a research paper, a technical report, a blog post, a data visualization, or anything else you think would advance your goal and allow you to develop or showcase your skills.\n\nBecause these presentations are necessarily short, we will have limited time for real-time Q&A during this session, but we will use a google doc to keep track of comments and suggestions in real time during the course session. This will give you useful feedback that will help guide your project going forward."

Given that we have a short period of time in which to complete this, I would encourage you to build on something you already are working on or an existing interest. The project consists of three components:\n\nProject Proposal: A short (2-3 page) proposal for what you would like to do, which includes some background on the topic of your project, its relevance to the field of spatial epidemiology, and some information about the goals of your project. Specifically, I am asking you to articulate:\n\nWhat is the problem you are tackling?: What is the problem you are proposing to focus on? Are you interested in a particular health outcome, a system of exposure (i.e. an environmental exposure or a social system such as racism/economic inequality?), or something else? Provide some evidence to show why developing a better understanding of how this system works and/or how to intervene in it is an important public health priority.\nProject Learning Goal: What would you like to learn through completing your project? It could be a statistical analysis approach, mapping skill, experience with a particular tool or framework (i.e. Shiny for R), or to learn more about the spatial dimensions of a public health topic of interest. Identify your key goal and briefly explain why it is important to you from an intellectual/academic and professional perspective.\nProposed project format: What do you anticipate producing for your project? It could be a research paper, a detailed data visualization, a map, an interactive app, or something eld`se entirely. Think about an output format that aligns with your identified learning goals. What could you produce that would be helpful for you in your professional or academic career, either for showcasing skills or pushing a project forward?\n\nProject Update: A brief (1-2 page) update on where you are in your project work and an opportunity to ask for feedback and/or have specific questions answered. Specifically, answer the following questions:\n\nWhat have you found most interesting or surprising so far in your investigations?\nWhat is confusing or something you need help thinking through?\nWhat modifications are you making to your project goals/outputs in response to what you have learned through your research so far?\n\nFinal Product: At the end of Week 4, I am asking you to submit your final product in whatever format and stage of completeness it is at.\n\nSelf-assessment: Along with your final product, please provide a short (~1 page) assessment of your progress towards the goals you set at the beginning of the project. A successful project doesn’t have to have hit the entire goal, but instead can be one that has either a) made progress towards it or b) highlighted that another goal is more worthy/important. Based on your self-assessment, please also suggest a letter grade (incl -/+, i.e. B+, A-, A) for the course. Unless your self-assessment is far out of line with my own, I will defer to your self-assessed grade.",

    "text": "The goal of the project for this course is to advance either or both your skill in spatial analysis and/or your knowledge of a particular topic area in spatial epidemiology. Given that we have a short period of time in which to complete this, I would encourage you to build on something you already are working on or an existing interest. The project consists of three components:\n\nProject Proposal: A short (2-3 page) proposal for what you would like to do, which includes some background on the topic of your project, its relevance to the field of spatial epidemiology, and some information about the goals of your project. Specifically, I am asking you to articulate:\n\nWhat is the problem you are tackling?: What is the problem you are proposing to focus on? Are you interested in a particular health outcome, a system of exposure (i.e. an environmental exposure or a social system such as racism/economic inequality?), or something else? Provide some evidence to show why developing a better understanding of how this system works and/or how to intervene in it is an important public health priority.\nProject Learning Goal: What would you like to learn through completing your project? It could be a statistical analysis approach, mapping skill, experience with a particular tool or framework (i.e. Shiny for R), or to learn more about the spatial dimensions of a public health topic of interest. Identify your key goal and briefly explain why it is important to you from an intellectual/academic and professional perspective.\nProposed project format: What do you anticipate producing for your project? It could be a research paper, a detailed data visualization, a map, an interactive app, or something eld`se entirely. Think about an output format that aligns with your identified learning goals. What could you produce that would be helpful for you in your professional or academic career, either for showcasing skills or pushing a project forward?\n\nProject Update: A brief (1-2 page) update on where you are in your project work and an opportunity to ask for feedback and/or have specific questions answered. Specifically, answer the following questions:\n\nWhat have you found most interesting or surprising so far in your investigations?\nWhat is confusing or something you need help thinking through?\nWhat modifications are you making to your project goals/outputs in response to what you have learned through your research so far?\n\nFinal Product: At the end of Week 4, I am asking you to submit your final product in whatever format and stage of completeness it is at.\n\nSelf-assessment: Along with your final product, please provide a short (~1 page) assessment of your progress towards the goals you set at the beginning of the project. A successful project doesn’t have to have hit the entire goal, but instead can be one that has either a) made progress towards it or b) highlighted that another goal is more worthy/important. Based on your self-assessment, please also suggest a letter grade (incl -/+, i.e. B+, A-, A) for the course. Unless your self-assessment is far out of line with my own, I will defer to your self-assessed grade.",

    "text": "Roadmap Project\nThroughout the term, you will complete a project in which you identify a problem of interest to you in spatial epidemiology and plot a path towards solving it. You will build and receive feedback on this project from me and your peers over the course of the term. In keeping with the spatial theme of the course, we will call this the Roadmap project because you will be asked to chart your own path from a spatial problem to a solution to the problem you have identified.\nThe nature of the problem and solution are up to you, but we will all approach it with the objective of being able to apply all of the following skills by the time you complete the project.\nAlthough a lot of the work on this project will be done outside of our course meetings, we will devote several class sessions to working on and presenting materials developed through completing the steps of this project. The stages of this project will address all of the course goals, with a particular focus on the fourth one - focused on integrating different sources of information on a spatial problem in epidemiology - via the final product of this semester-long project.\n\nProject Stages\nYou will build towards the final project in stages over the course of the term through the following four sub-assignments:\n\nWhat is the origin?\nWhat is the destination?\nPostcard from the road\nFinal Product\n\n\n\nAssessment and Grading\nYou will be evaluating your own progress and the match between what you were able to accomplish and your goals at the outset. The point of having this be self-assessed is to make sure you pick something that is of interest and use to you, not what you imagine what I want from you. Please spend some time thinking about how this project could best address your short- and long-term academic and career goals.\nThis could be anything from learning a new analytical skill, deepening your knowledge about a particular epidemiological topic or set of policy/practice tools.\nI encourage you to think about other uses for the final product of this semester-long project: How could you use it to lay the foundation for a fellowship application, create a portfolio to showcase your work to potential employers, or do anything else that is important to you?\nFor example, your final product could include any of the following:\n\nA podcast episode introducing your topic and some of your ideas/research on it.\nA spatial data visualization with accompanying explanation; can be presented in the form of a set of social media posts, a blog entry, or as a printed document.\nA policy white paper meant to inform public and political debate around issues related to your problem of choice.\nA pamphlet or some other type of public health communication meant to be shared in practice setting, e.g. in a clinic, during outreach, etc.\n\nIt could also very well be something not on this list - you just need to justify why you are taking the approach you choose."

Our course policies are developed with that in mind and with the goal of creating an environment of mutual respect that also fosters intellectual exploration, creativity and productive risk-taking. If at any point you feel that these goals are not being met, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.\n\n\nThis class will be held in-person and students are asked and expected to attend in-person whenever possible. If you do need to miss class for whatever reason, please let me know ahead of time so that we can plan accordingly.\nI will record each class session using Zoom and make the link to these recordings available to the entire class. When we have a guest speaker, these sessions will be recorded if the visiting speaker consents.\nIf you are unable to attend in person but can join via Zoom, that will be an option. However, since the class is heavily focused on discussion, in-class activities, and project work, the utility of these recordings and remote participation will be limited primarily to listening to and reviewing the lecture portions of the class.\n\n\n\nDue dates for assignments have been chosen to ensure that there is enough time to give detailed feedback prior to the due date for the next assignment. However, I know that life often intervenes in the form of either personal obligations or other assignments which can make it difficult to get every assignment in on time. If you do not anticipate being able to make a due date, please let me know as far ahead of time as possible so that we can arrange an extension.\n\n\n\nI believe that detailed, qualitative feedback from instructors and peers is far more useful than numerical grading. Numerical grading schemes disincentivize exploration and risk-taking, rewarding consistency over the course of a term over growth. Assignment assessments and final grades for this course are constructed with the goal of facilitating growth and exploration within a student-centered environment. This, of course, entails a slightly different set of expectations and responsibilities for students and instructors than in a course following a classic grading/assessment scheme.\n\n\n\nThere will be no numerical or letter grades given for written assignments or presentations, including the final product of your semester-long project. Instead, you will receive written feedback from me on each assignment, and will also have a number of opportunities to share your ideas and receive constructive feedback from your classmates.\nThis will include in-class presentations on your research topic, structured peer-reviews of work-in-progress, in-class ‘workshop’ time to work with your project group and get advice from me and your classmates, as well as periodic self-assessments that you will submit to me.\nFollowing fall break, I will ask you to submit responses to a midterm check-in survey, which will allow me to better understand what is working and not working for you in the class so that we can make adjustments for the second half of the term.\n\n[!NOTE] For peer and self-assessments, I will provide a template containing an outline of the areas I am asking you to give feedback on. These assessment opportunities are meant to help keep you on track and to flag individual and collective issues (i.e. unclear assignment instructions, questions about assignment topics, format, etc. as they arise).\n\n\n\n\nFinal course grades will be self-assigned and based on each student’s assessment of their progress towards their self-identified goals as well as those identified by me over the course of the term. I reserve the right to revise final grades upwards or downwards if necessary, but will only do this only in rare cases where a student’s self-assessed grade is strongly out of alignment with my perception of their performance in the course, and in all others will take the student’s self-assessed grade as-is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions to self-grading\n\n\n\nThe primary factors that would result in a downward revision of a student’s self-assessed grade are 1) chronic, unexplained lateness in turning in assignments or not completing assignments, 2) instances of academic dishonesty.\n\n\nWhile consistent in-person attendance is expected, I understand that personal, professional and academic circumstances may periodically impact your ability to attend either in-person or remotely. I will not take attendance during regular course sessions and an excused absence is not required on most days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-class presentations and feedback\n\n\n\nHowever, on days when students are presenting and giving/receiving feedback, attendance or an excused absence is required and unexplained/excused absence may result in a downward revision of your final grade.

    "text": "Spatial Epidemiology is All About Relationships\nThe focus of this class session will be on understanding the concept of spatial autocorrelation and variation and what they means for epidemiological analysis. Where variation is large, we should expect to see big differences from place to place.\nAutocorrelation is about how that variation plays out over space: Where there is strong spatial autocorrelation, things that are close to each other are far more likely to be similar than things that are far away from each other. But one can have strong autocorrelation and low variation, high variation and no autocorrelation, and on and on…\nWe will spend this class session trying to make sense of this concept in qualitative terms, first by discussing a pair of articles that nicely lay out the key ideas here, and then by doing a hands-on activity focused on visualizing patterns of spatial variation and autocorrelation using a spatial smoothing approach.\n\nBefore Class\nPlease read the following two pieces that discuss key ideas about geospatial relatedness:\nMiller HJ. Tobler’s First Law and Spatial Analysis. Annals of the Association of American Geographers. 2004;94(2):284-289. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09402005.x\nGoodchild MF.

This piece has specific recommendations for analysts around model construction and accounting for multiple, intersecting identities.\n(Noppert, Hegde, and Kubale 2022) articulate a framework based on fundamental cause theory for accounting for and addressing inequities in infection risk. (Zelner, Naraharisetti, and Zelner 2023) is an invited commentary that builds on some of the ideas in the original piece.\n(Chowkwanyun and Reed 2020) is an excellent piece from early in the COVID-19 pandemic which highlights many of the challenges and pitfalls associated with a focus on racial health disparities without adequate attention to their material causes.\n\n\n\nModeling for Equity\n\n(Zelner et al. 2022) and (Abuelezam et al. 2023) attempt to articulate frameworks for doing a better job of using epidemic models to capture the dynamics of inequity in infection and disease outcomes.\n(Ma et al. 2021) is an excellent data-driven exercise in modeling the linkages between race/ethnicity, essential work and inequity in disease outcomes.\n(Nande et al. 2021) is a data-informed simulation model of the potential impact of ending the CDC eviction moratorium on population-wide infection risks and group-specific disparities.\nThis is a hands-on example we put together that translates the framework in (Acevedo-Garcia 2000) into a simple dynamic model of the relationship between residential segregation and infection.\n\n\n\nMethodological challenges\n\n(Zelner et al. 2020) is an analysis examining the relative impacts of case-fatality vs. incidence of infection in inequities in COVID-19 mortality in Michigan.\n(Trangucci, Chen, and Zelner 2022) presents a computationally efficient Bayesian method for accounting for non-random missingness of race-ethnicity data without making restrictive assumptions and/or using surname coding.\nThis is a hands-on comparison of different metrics of spatial segregation applied to the same simulated dataset.\n\n(If you’d like a bibtex file w/these resources, you can find it here)"

That ‘‘few of these alleys, many of which are not over ten feet wide, are fit for habitations’’ was largely the fault of unscrupulous landlords and the city’s failure to regulate them. He thus called into question “the conscience of the American people” who “ignore[d] the fact that little children” were “compelled to live [where] sunlight, pure air, pure thoughts, chaste conduct and associates . . . are denied them from their very birth.” (Roberts 2009, 132)\n\n\n\nAlso recognized that any chance of reform rested on the ability to make common cause with white male leaders of Baltimore."

    "text": "🚪 Door 3: Partial Pooling\nFinally, we get to the partial pooling, hierarchical model in which we introduce a hierarchical prior to the model to allow our model to shrink observations from places with few observations towards the population mean. This allows us to avoid the pitfalls of overfitting associated with the no-pooling approach while not making the homogeneity assumptions associated with the full-pooling approach.\nThis works out to a multi-level model that allows random variation in household-level radon measurements as well as variation at the county level in radon levels above or below the amount predicted by the county-level soil uranium measure. Much like the no-pooling model, we can write outcomes for individuals as:\n\\[\ny_{ij} = \\alpha_j + \\beta x_{ij} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\]\nHowever, rather than stopping there, we introduce a second level of random variation to the county-level intercepts, \\(\\alpha_j\\).\n\\[\n\\alpha_j = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma \\zeta_{j} + \\epsilon_{j}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_i)\\) and \\(\\epsilon_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma_j)\\).\nTo fit this model, we’ll use the rstanarm package, which uses the Stan Bayesian modeling language under the hook to fit the model. This model introduces another piece of syntax to our equation, which now reads log_radon ~ basement + log_uranium + (1 | county). The interesting part of this is the (1 | county) which is a syntax used by rstanarm and other hierarchical modeling packages (such as lme4) to specify random intercepts (typically represented by a 1 in the matrix of regressors) for each of a set of clusters, in this case counties. In this model, the county-level intercept terms are implicitly assumed to be normally distributed with unknown variance \\(\\sigma_j\\) which will be estimated when the model is fit.\nWe use the stan_lmer function to fit a hierarchical linear model with a normally-distributed response variable, as follows:\n\nm2 &lt;- stan_lmer(log_radon ~ basement + log_uranium + (1 | county), data = radon)\n\nBecause this model is fit by MCMC, we can use draws from the posterior distribution to understand uncertainty in the model. For example, this visualization of the median prediction and credible intervals for the basement and uranium effects can be visualized using the mcmc_areas function from the bayesplot package:\n\nposterior &lt;- as.matrix(m2)\ng2 &lt;- mcmc_areas(posterior, pars = c(\"basement\", \"log_uranium\"))\nplot(g2)"

To do this, we use the predicted_draws function from the tidybayes package, which lets us sample from the posterior distribution of the fitted model. The median_qi function, also from tidybayes, lets us calculate the width of a 1 standard error interval (equivalent to the range containing ~17% of the posterior probability mass around the posterior median) used in the original Figure 1 from Gelman (2006):\n\ndd &lt;- predicted_draws(m2, county_dummy_df) %&gt;%\n  median_qi(.width = 0.17) %&gt;%\n  filter(basement == 0)\n\nIn order to calculate the predicted mean radon at a county level, we need to access the coefficients corresponding to the level two model, including the intercept \\(\\gamma_0\\) and the effect of a 1-log change in log-uranium on predicted log-radon, \\(\\gamma_1\\).
