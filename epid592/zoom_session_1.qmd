## Goals for today

- Answer any <span class="alert">burning</span> üî• questions about Week 1 and the class in general.

- <span class="alert">Digest</span> and <span class="alert">synthesize</span> Week 1 content.

- Think ahead to Week 2.

## Agenda 

- Who am I and why do I care so much about spatial epidemiology (~10m)

- Week 1 questions and concerns (~25m)

- Zoom fatigue ü•±/bio break (5m)

- Week 1 concept-mapping (~30m)

- Looking ahead to Week 2 (~5m)

## Who am I & what do I do?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}

- Infectious disease epidemiologist.

- Trained as a social epidemiologist/sociologist (UM Sociology PhD 2011).

- Research group focused on health geography and transmission modeling.

- Infection <span class="alert">inequity</span> is the theme that motivates most of our work.

## Got a first-hand feel for what it's like to think spatially about an emerging public health event {.imgslide}

## Spatial models are just <span class="alert">mental models</span> formalizing the relationships between spatial arrangements and disease outcomes

<blockquote>[M]ental models and empirical data keep each other in check - [Sir Peter Medawar] described them 
  respectively as the ‚Äòbride‚Äô and ‚Äògroom‚Äô of science ‚Äî and scientific progress in any discipline occurs by the
  back-and-forth dialogue between their two ‚Äòvoices‚Äô.‚Äù</blockquote>

  [From Greenhalgh 2021: *Miasmas, mental models and preventive public
  health*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2021.0017)


## <span class="alert">Week 1</span> Recap 

We have covered a lot of territory:

- What is <span class="alert">spatial epidemiology</span>, anyway? 

- What is the role of <span class="alert">mapping</span> üó∫Ô∏è in spatial epid?

- Spatial patterns of health outcomes as the output of complex socio-epidemiological <span class="alert">systems</span> ‚öôÔ∏è.

## What questions or ideas did this week's readings, videos, and assignments spark ‚ú®?

Open up this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRzmusTtqK51G5I2jHhDeFpT_Kh54Vw5nLwfaXrOFhY/edit?usp=sharing) and add your answer to each of the following questions:

1. In 1-2 sentences, how would you describe what <span class="alert">spatial epidemiology</span> is?

2. What did you find most surprising or interesting from the course this week?

3. What left you confused or would be helpful to <span class="alert">clarify</span>?

## Bringing the threads üß∂ together with a mind-mapping exercise

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Much like a geographic map, a mind-map uses distance/connections to help us think about the relatedness of concepts.

- Start with a central problem or question and branch out from there.

- Goal is to use this exercise to clarify connections between readings from this week and set an agenda going forward.

## Lets take some time to <span class="alert">map out</span> these ideas and their connections.

- Going to break into 4 groups

- Spend 5-7m on each of four questions as a group in a breakout room.

- Goal is to <span class="alert">synthesize</span> material from the week and build on each other's understanding.

- At the end, we will briefly review all of the maps and pick out <span class="alert">major themes</span>.

## Building your mind maps

## Next Week

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Why focus on a historical outbreak in a course on spatial epidemiology?

- Detailed examination of interacting social, environmental and biological forces.

- Shows the long arc of learning behind a dramatic and important event in epidemiological history.

- Shows how spatial analysis is at the center of much epidemiological practice even if we don't always notice it.
