## Agenda

- Your thoughts/questions/concerns about this week's course materials. (~25m)

- Making sense of *The Ghost Map* together (~25m)

- Break (5m)

- Taking some time to go hands-on with John Snow's data (~30m)

# Making sense of The Ghost Map

## A quote I love from *The Ghost Map* {.quote}

<blockquote>
"Most world-historic events - great military battles, political revolutions - are self-consciously historic to the
participants living through them. They act knowing that their decisions will be chronicled and dissected for decades or
centuries to come. But <span class="alert">epidemics create a kind of history from below</span>: they can be world-changing, but the participants are almost inevitably ordinary folk, following their established routines, not thinking for a second about how their actions will be recorded for posterity." (From *The Ghost Map*, p. 32)
</blockquote>

## On your own:

Take ~10m to go back to your notes etc to answer the following questions in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDMFx2Vix9r5owOpHRg7tkOl_404TONCDxhRxBtTYdk/edit?usp=sharing):

- What did you find most striking or interesting about the readings for this week? 

- How did the account in *The Ghost Map* impact the way you think about spatial epidemiology?

- What did you find confusing or think would benefit from clarification?

## Human waste was an unavoidable fact of life in Victorian London

> Victorian London had its postcard wonders, to be sure‚Äîthe Crystal  Palace, Trafalgar Square, the new additions to Westminster Palace. But it also had wonders of a different order, no less remarkable: artificial ponds of raw sewage, dung heaps the size of houses. [@johnson2007, p.11]

> Water closets were a tremendous breakthrough as far as quality of life was concerned, but they had a disastrous effect on the city‚Äôs sewage problem. Without a functioning sewer system to connect to, most WCs simply flushed their contents into existing cesspools, <span class="alert">greatly increasing their tendency to overflow</span>.

## Chewing over The Ghost Map {.smaller}

Each small group will take on one of these questions and then report back to the big group at the end:

1. Why was <span class="alert">miasma a compelling explanation</span> for outbreaks of Cholera in South London? Think specifically about the how the theory did - or didn't - predict spatial patterning of Cholera death in London.

2. How did Snow use data from earlier, <span class="alert">small-scale</span> Cholera outbreaks in 1848 & 1849 to argue in favor of the germ theory of Cholera over miasma?

3. What was the logic behind Snow's <span class="alert">*grand experiment* </span> or *experimentum crucis* prior to the 1854 outbreak? What were some of its weaknesses?

4. What were some of the <span class="alert">exceptions that proved the rule</span> in Snow and Whitehead's explorations of the 1854 Golden Square outbreak? In other words, how did they approach cases that seemed to deviate from the predictions of their mental model that individuals who lived closer to the pump were at greatest risk?

## I smell a rat...

> "[I]t was stretching matters beyond belief to suggest that the room should suddenly become prone to those poisonous vapors the very day it was occupied by a sailor traveling from a city beseiged by the disease."

## In Snow's words

> "Who can doubt that the case of John Harnold...was the true cause of the malady in Blenkinsopp...And if cholera be communicated in some instances, is there not the strongest possibility that it is so in the others - in short, that <span class="alert">similar effects depend on similar causes<span>."

## What happened in the 1849 <span class="alert">Thomas street outbreak</span> that drove these ideas home for Snow?

:::{.fragment}
> "Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around shared water supplies. <span class="alert">If the miasma theory were right, why would it draw such arbitrary distinctions?</span> Why would the cholera devastate one building but leave the one next door unscathed? Why would one slum suffer twice the losses as a slum with arguably worse sanitary conditions?" (Johnson, p.74)

<h1 style="font-size: 3em; color: white; -webkit-text-stroke:2px black">The Grand Experiment</h1>

## What was the *experimentum crucis*?

- Snow took advantage of changes in infrastructure to compare neighborhoods served with contaminated and clean water.

- Example of a natural experiment.

- Exploits some kind of random variation in exposure to make causal inferences where they would otherwise not be possible.

- What are some other possible examples of a natural experiment?


## Changes in London water service provided an opportunity for Snow
<div class="toprow">
  <div class="textcolumn">
  <ul>
  <li>Around 1850, parliament mandated that all water companies move their intake beyond the outflow of the Thames by 1855</li>
  <li class="fragment">In south London there were two major water suppliers: Southwark & Vauxhall (S&V) and Lambeth.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Lambeth moved the intake up in 1852, but S&V waited until 1855.</li>

</div>

## Snow's map of water suppliers

<img src="../images/snow_water_map.jpg">

## Conducting the grand experiment

- Snow divided data into sub-districts of South London organized by water supplier.

- 12 were served by only S&V, 3 by Lambeth alone

- <span class="alert">1/100</span> people died of Cholera in S&V only districts, but none among the > 14K living in Lambeth districts

## What made the Grand Experiment <span class="alert">inconclusive</span>?

-  16 sub-districts were served by both suppliers

- Within these districts, water service was overlapping at a fine scale.

- Snow went door-to-door...but people living in these districts often had no idea where their water came from.

- So, he collected water from them and tried to find evidence of the causal agent of Cholera in the sample
