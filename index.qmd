Welcome to my personal blog and teaching website. My name is Jon Zelner, and I am an Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the [University of Michigan School of Public Health](https://sph.umich.edu/epid/) (UM SPH), where I conduct research and teach about the social and spatial epidemiology of infectious disease. I am also  a core faculty member of the Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health, also at UM SPH.

I lead the [EpiBayes](https://epibayes.io) research group, which is also focused on these issues, as well as the development of Bayesian statistical methods for applied epidemiology.
