## Goals for today

- Discuss what it means to take a <span class="alert">systems perspective </span> on public health problems

- Talk about how epidemiological systems models have, and have not, dealt well with social inequity before - and during - the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Highlight why developing mathematical and spatial models that reflect a diversity of understandings about <span class="alert">how transmission systems work</span> is essential for health equity.

# What are we talking about when we talk about <span class="alert">models</span> and <span class="alert">modeling</span>?

## What is an <span class="alert">epidemiological model</span> for?

- Represent explicit ideas about how transmission <span class="alert">systems</span> work.

- Explore the relative contributions of <span class="alert">individual</span>, <span class="alert">spatial</span>, and <span class="alert">social/environmental</span> relationships to transmission risks.

- Let us take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on infectious diseases.

## Causal loop diagrams often used to <span class="alert">represent</span> systems

## What does it mean to take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on real-world social and public health problems?

Open up this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9XWl285JQMNMPLfJUthSlqITshAa2GB2jk0kU1zlvo/edit?usp=sharing) and answer the following questions:

- <span class="alert">On your own:</span> In general?

- <span class="alert">In groups of 2:</span> About infectious diseases?

- <span class="alert">In groups of 4-6:</span> About social inequity in <span class="alert">infection</span> outcomes?


## This talk reflects lessons learned from the experience of mapping COVID-19 in Michigan {.imgslide}

<img src="/images/covidmapping_april_2022.png">

Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in Michigan 3/2020-3/2022 (from [covidmapping.org](https://www.covidmapping.org))

## Modeling has become a key element of pandemic <span class="alert">preparedness</span>. {.imgslide}

<blockquote>"Pandemic preparedness is a continuous process of planning, exercising, revising and translating into action national and
sub-national pandemic preparedness and response plans. A pandemic plan is thus a <span class="alert">living document</span> which is reviewed regularly and revised if necessary...based on the lessons learnt from outbreaks or a pandemic, or from a
simulation exercise."</blockquote>

[WHO
2011](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/pandemic-influenza/pandemic-preparedness)

## Much of the power of models comes from how they shape our <span class="alert">intuition</span>

Models can let us:

<div class="toprow">
  <div class="textcolumn"><ul>
    <li class = "fragment">Characterize rates of transmission, severe disease and death in different populations and <span class="alert">locations</span>.</li>
    <li class = "fragment">Estimate impacts of medical interventions on risk over space and time.</li>
    <li class="fragment">Explore the implications of social and political change on the spatial and social distribution of infection risk.</li>
    </ul></div>

  <div style="flex:50%"><blockquote style="font-size: 0.6em;">
    Intuition pumps are cunningly designed [thought experiments, which] <span class="alert">focus the reader's attention on "the important"
    features</span>, and...deflect the
    reader from bogging down in hard-to-follow details. (From Dennett, 1984)</blockquote></div>
</div>

## Early pandemic models focused on key <span class="alert">priorities</span>

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Spatial variation in risks of infection and death.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Age-specific incidence and mortality.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Community-level hospital and ICU capacity.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Short-term forecasting of population incidence and mortality</li>
  <li class="fragment">Localized impacts of lockdowns on infection risk.</li>
  <span class="fragment">
    <span class="fragment strike highlight-red">
      <li>
        Economic and racial inequality in infection and disease risk</li>
    </span></span>
</ul>

## Economic and racial inequity is a central story of the COVID-19 pandemic {.imgslide}

<div class="r-stack">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/blacks_covid_death_brookings.png" width="600">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/harvard_inequality_on_top_of_inequality.png" width="400">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/mistrust_communities_of_color.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/minorities_covid_uk.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/omicron_black_chicago.png" width="400"></div>

So why were we not <span class="alert">prepared</span> for these easy-to-foresee inequities?

## The myth of the <span class="alert">equal opportunity infector</span> may have obscured inequality

<div class="r-stack">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/equal_opportunity_virus.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/equal_opportunity_herald.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/equal_opportunity_rural.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="/images/equal_opportunity_delta.png">
  </div>


## What does it mean to be an equal opportunity infector?

 - <span class="alert">Susceptibility</span> is uniformly distributed across the population.
 
 - Host and pathogen biology are the most important factors in determining <span class="alert">infectiousness.</span>
 - Protective <span class="alert">health behaviors</span> equally available to everyone.

- Socio-spatial differences in <span class="alert">exposure</span> by race and wealth are dwarfed by these biological factors.
</span>

<span class="fragment">*Modelers don't have to believe these things are true for them to end up in our models!*</span>

## We have to understand the <span class="alert">mental models</span> guiding our mathematical ones to figure out how to fix them. {.quote}

<blockquote>[M]ental models and empirical data keep each other in check - [Sir Peter Medawar] described them 
  respectively as the ‘bride’ and ‘groom’ of science — and scientific progress in any discipline occurs by the
  back-and-forth dialogue between their two ‘voices’.”</blockquote>

  [From Greenhalgh 2021: *Miasmas, mental models and preventive public
  health*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2021.0017)


## Dissecting the mental model behind the <span class="alert">equal opportunity infector</span> idea 

Key Questions:

>- What types of <span class="alert">data</span> do these models use? Why?
>- Who has been the typical <span class="alert">audience</span> for epidemiological models? Is that changing?
>- What can we do to expand our toolkit to address these critical questions?

## Who are epidemiological models <span class="alert">for</span>?

>- Public health officials making *decisions*.
>- Scientists and physicians pursuing *interventions*.
>- Politicians implementing *policy* and trying to maintain *power*.
>- Media constructing an easily-digestible *narrative*.

<p class="fragment" style="text-align: center;">What <span class="alert">perspective</span> do these groups have in
  common?</p>


## This has led to a focus on a set of <span class="alert">outcomes</span> that aligns with these interests

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Incidence of disease over time.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Prevalence of infection at any given moment in time.</li>
<li class="fragment">Mortality and case-fatality rates.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Distributions of infection and mortality by age.</li>
  <span class="fragment">
    <span class="fragment strike highlight-red">
      <li>Distribution of infection and mortality by neighborhood, socieconomic status, and race/ethnicity.</li></span></span>
</ul>

## Modeling of <span class="alert">acute infections</span> has emerged from a rich tradition in population ecology

>- Key model parameters like $R_0$ traditionally describe *average* properties of infection in a well-mixed population.
>- Key ideas are borrowed from classic models of predator/prey dynamics and birth/death processes.
>- Ecological modeling has an extensive toolkit for characterizing <span class="alert">demographic</span> and <span class="alert">spatial</span> variation in outcomes.
>- But we have been slow to make the leap to characterizing the <span class="alert">socio-structural</span> determinants of infection.

## OK, but this was so <span style="color:red">obvious!</span>

    alt="Charlie Brown and Lucy - kicking the FOOTBALL"></a>

<div style="font-size:1em;">How did we miss the fact that <span class="alert">justice</span> is a critical dimension of preparedness?</div>

## Historical analyses have repeatedly demonstrated inequity in prior pandemics {.imgslide}

[Grantz et al., *PNAS* 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27872284/)

## The mechanisms of inequity were quickly identified, but our models weren't ready for them {.imgslide}

<img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/racial_capitalism_mcclure.png">

## COVID-19 provides an opportunity to reflect on the goals of  modeling and analysis in public health {.quote}

<blockquote>
  COVID-19 disparities are not the fault of those who are experiencing them, but rather reflect social policies and
  systems that create health disparities in good times and inflate them in a crisis. <span class="alert">The US must develop a new kind of
  “herd immunity,” whereby resistance to the spread of poor health in the population occurs when a sufficiently high
  proportion of individuals, across all racial, ethnic, and social class groups, are protected from and thus “immune” to
  negative social determinants.</span>
</blockquote>
 From Williams & Cooper, ["COVID-19 and Health Equity—A New Kind of “Herd Immunity”](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766096), JAMA, 6/23/2020

## What could an <span class="alert">alternative</span> framework look like? 

<div class="toprow">
  <div class="textcolumn"><ul>
      <li class="fragment">Model <span class="alert">spatially localized</span> infection risks as a function of upstream social determinants.</li>
      <li class="fragment">Represent <span class="alert">correlation</span> between effects of factors such as racism and SES on spatial variation in infection risks.</li>
      <li class="fragment">Examine differential impacts of social inequity on <span class="alert">contact</span>, <span class="alert">susceptibility</span>, and <span class="alert">infectiousness.</span></li>
    </ul>

## These <span class="alert">equity-oriented</span> models let us ask crucial questions about the causes of disparity {.imgslide}

## Modeler $\to$ Mental Model $\to$ Transmission Model

- It matters <span class="alert">who</span> is developing the model.

- Spatial and transmission modeling in epidemiology need to reflect diveristy in <span class="alert">intellectual perspectives</span>

- And <span class="alert">life experiences</span>

- And <span class="alert">economic</span> and <span class="alert">political</span> interests
