They act knowing that their decisions will be chronicled and dissected for decades or\ncenturies to come. But <span class=\"alert\">epidemics create a kind of history from below</span>: they can be world-changing, but the participants are almost inevitably ordinary folk, following their established routines, not thinking for a second about how their actions will be recorded for posterity.\" (From *The Ghost Map*, p. 32)\n</blockquote>\n\n## {data-background-image=\"../images/snow_map.png\"}\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size: 3em; color: white; -webkit-text-stroke:2px black\">The Ghost Map</h1>\n\n\n## On your own:\n\nTake ~10m to go back to your notes etc to answer the following questions in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDMFx2Vix9r5owOpHRg7tkOl_404TONCDxhRxBtTYdk/edit?usp=sharing):\n\n- What did you find most striking or interesting about the readings for this week? \n\n- How did the account in *The Ghost Map* impact the way you think about spatial epidemiology?\n\n- What did you find confusing or think would benefit from clarification?\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(countdown)\ncountdown(minutes = 10, warn_when = 120, seconds = 0, play_sound=TRUE)\n```\n\n## Human waste was an unavoidable fact of life in Victorian London\n\n> Victorian London had its postcard wonders, to be sure‚Äîthe Crystal  Palace, Trafalgar Square, the new additions to Westminster Palace.

Why was <span class=\"alert\">miasma a compelling explanation</span> for outbreaks of Cholera in South London? Think specifically about the how the theory did - or didn't - predict spatial patterning of Cholera death in London.\n\n2. How did Snow use data from earlier, <span class=\"alert\">small-scale</span> Cholera outbreaks in 1848 & 1849 to argue in favor of the germ theory of Cholera over miasma?\n\n3. What was the logic behind Snow's <span class=\"alert\">*grand experiment* </span> or *experimentum crucis* prior to the 1854 outbreak? What were some of its weaknesses?\n\n4. What were some of the <span class=\"alert\">exceptions that proved the rule</span> in Snow and Whitehead's explorations of the 1854 Golden Square outbreak? In other words, how did they approach cases that seemed to deviate from the predictions of their mental model that individuals who lived closer to the pump were at greatest risk?\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(countdown)\ncountdown(minutes = 15, warn_when = 120, seconds = 0, play_sound=TRUE)\n```\n\n# Break! \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(countdown)\ncountdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60, seconds = 0, play_sound=TRUE)\n```\n\n\n\n## Hands-on with the Golden Square data\n\n[https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/john-snow-cholera/](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/john-snow-cholera/)\n\n## {data-background-image=\"../images/snow_map.png\"}\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size: 3em; color: white; -webkit-text-stroke:2px black\">Snow's Road to analyzing the 1854 Outbreak</h1>\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"../images/elbe_arrival.png\" width=\"400\">\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"../images/elbe_blenkinsopp.png\">\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"../images/elbe_spread.png\">\n\n## I smell a rat...\n\n> \"[I]t was stretching matters beyond belief to suggest that the room should suddenly become prone to those poisonous vapors the very day it was occupied by a sailor traveling from a city beseiged by the disease.\"\n\n## In Snow's words\n\n> \"Who can doubt that the case of John Harnold...was the true cause of the malady in Blenkinsopp...And if cholera be communicated in some instances, is there not the strongest possibility that it is so in the others - in short, that <span class=\"alert\">similar effects depend on similar causes<span>.\"\n\n## What happened in the 1849 <span class=\"alert\">Thomas street outbreak</span> that drove these ideas home for Snow?\n\n:::{.fragment}\n> \"Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around shared water supplies. <span class=\"alert\">If the miasma theory were right, why would it draw such arbitrary distinctions?</span> Why would the cholera devastate one building but leave the one next door unscathed?
