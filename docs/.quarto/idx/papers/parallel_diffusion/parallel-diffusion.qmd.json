[@clouston2016] described the life-cycle of a fundamental cause, where they detailed the rise and fall of inequity in access to a given health innovation (See @fig-fct). Much like the segregation and transmission model put together by Acevedo-Garcia [@acevedo-garcia2000], this has never really been subject to simulation, particularly in the realm of infectious disease epidemiology.\n\n![Diffusion of health-promoting innovation across levels of SES, replicated from [@clouston2016]](20221003090732.png){#fig-fct}  \n\n### Capturing innovation 'diffusion' by SES\n\nHow can we capture the heterogeneous distribution of innovation access times pictured in @fig-fct? Lets start with a simple example, in which there are two groups representing high and low SES individuals. Some proportion $\\eta$ of individuals in the population belong to the high-SES group, with the remaining $1-\\eta$ individuals in the lower-SES group.\n\nWe can denote $\\zeta_L$ as the rate of access for the lower-SES population, and $\\tau \\ge 1$ as a parameter scaling the rate of access for the high-SES group. We can then express the overall access rate as $\\zeta = \\eta \\tau \\zeta_L + (1-\\eta) \\zeta_L$\n\n```{r}\n## High-ses group innovation access times\naccessTimes <- function(pHigh, popSize, tau, zeta) {\n\nnH <- floor(pHigh*popSize)\nnL <- popSize-nH\nx1 <- rexp(nH, tau*zeta)\nx2 <- rexp(nL, zeta)\nz <- c(x1,x2)\nreturn(z)\n}\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the top 20% of the population gets access twice as fast as the lower 80%:\n\n```{r}\nz <- accessTimes(0.2, 1000, 2, 0.5)\nhist(z, breaks=100)\nplot(ecdf(z))\n\n```\n\nIn this one, the rate is much higher at 5 times faster\n\n```{r}\nz <- accessTimes(0.2, 1000, 5, 0.5)\nhist(z, breaks=100)\nplot(ecdf(z))\n```\n\nWe can compare these visually to the equal-access (or equal rate of access) version as follows:\n\n```{r}\nmean_rate <- 1/mean(z)\nprint(mean_rate)\nhist(rexp(1000, mean_rate), breaks = 100)\n```\n\nIn the heterogeneous rate version, more people have very early access times, with more people with higher-than-average wait times in the right tail of the distribution.\n\n### ODE Model\n\nWe can represent this intuition by including separate SES classes in an ODE-based transmission model. \n\nTo do this, we can have multiple susceptible states, including a protected state that individuals enter when they get access to the innovation. \n\nIn a simple, mass-action version of this model, we have plain-old susceptibility, a protected state that individuals flow into at a constant rate, and infectious and susceptible individuals in all groups mix evenly.\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n    S1[S1:High SES] --> |τη| B[Protected]\n    S2[S2: Low SES] --> |η| B[Protected]\n    B --> |ρβI| I\n    S1 -->  |βI| I[Infected]\n    S2 --> |βI| I[Infected]\n    I --> |ᵞ| R[Recovered]\n``` \n\n\n\nWhere:\n\n- $\\beta$ is the rate of transmission\n- $\\rho$ is the reduction in infection risk associated with protection\n- $\\tau$ is the rate at which lower-SES individuals get access\n\n- $\\tau \\eta$ is the rate at which individuals in the high-SES group get access to the innovation, where $\\tau \\ge 1$.\n\n## References"},"formats":{"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"parallel-diffusion.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"title":"Parallel diffusion of innovation and infection","author":"Jon Zelner","date":"\\today","bibliography":["/Users/jzelner/repos/bibtex-library/jz_library.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
