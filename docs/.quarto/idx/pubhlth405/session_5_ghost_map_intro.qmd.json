They act knowing that their decisions will be chronicled and dissected for decades or\ncenturies to come. But <span class=\"alert\">epidemics create a kind of history from below</span>: they can be world-changing, but the participants are almost inevitably ordinary folk, following their established routines, not thinking for a second about how their actions will be recorded for posterity.\" (From *The Ghost Map*, p. 32)\n</blockquote>\n\n## Stepping into Golden Square\n\n- What <span class=\"alert\">social</span> and <span class=\"alert\">environmental</span> factors made 1850s London an ideal environment for Cholera transmission?\n\n- What <span class=\"alert\">global</span> üåç changes impacted London's Cholera risk in the 19th century?\n\n- How did urbanization impact the evolution of *V.

But it also had wonders of a different order, no less remarkable: artificial ponds of raw sewage, dung heaps the size of houses.
