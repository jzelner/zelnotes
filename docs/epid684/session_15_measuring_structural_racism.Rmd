# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.quoteslide}

How can we appropriately <span class="alert">measure</span> the impacts of structural racism on spatial health inequality?

# Agenda

>- Methodological considerations in the measurement of <span class="alert">structural racism</span>.

>- Measuring the impact of segregation over the <span class="alert">lifecourse</span> on CVD risk.

>- Mind-mapping of key concepts and outcomes re: segregation, structural racism, and health inequality wrt your final projects.

# <span class="alert">Values</span> and <span class="alert">biases</span> are baked into the ways we measure...everything. {.imgslide}

Suggestions for accurately measuring the nature of and impact of structural racism on health outcomes (From Adkins-Jackson et al., 2021)

# How does exposure to racial residential segregation impact cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk?

>- Kershaw et al. used longitudinal data from 2280 Black participants of a cohort study taking place in 4 cities. 

>- Neighborhood-level intensity of exposure to segregation was a key input to the model.

>- Variation in <span class="alert">systolic blood pressure</span> was used as an indicator of CVD risk.

# How might <span class="alert">residential segregation</span> impact CVD risk?

>- Stress

>- Access to medical care

>- Quality of overall physical environment.

>- Food access 

>- And on, and on...

# How can we measure <span class="alert">individual-level</span> exposure to segregation?

>- Measures like <span class="alert">isolation</span>, <span class="alert">dissimilarity</span>, <span class="alert">centralization</span> are all summaries of segregation or clustering in a given area.

>-  Statistics like the Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ allow us to capture <span class="alert">local variation</span> in exposure.

>- $G_i$ is the predecessor to $G_i^*$. Captures the same basic idea but is a bit more intutive.

>- Uses information on a location and its surrounding areas to estimate local intensity.

# Getis-Ord $G_i$ statistic

$$G_{i}(d)=\frac{\sum_{j}w_{ij}(d)x_j}{\sum_{j}x_j}$$

Where:

>- $d$ is the maximum <span class="alert">distance</span> to consider clustering 

>- $w_{ij}(d)=1$ if place $i$ and place $j$ are within $d$ of each other, and 0 otherwise. (When $i=j$, $w_{ij}=0$)

>- $x_j$ is the variable of interest

>- Yields an estimate of both <span class="alert">strength of clustering</span> and approximate statistical significance.

# Long-term cohort design in Kershaw et al. allows study of <span class="alert">within-person</span> changes in exposure to segregation.

>- Allows adjustment for individual-level factors such as age, sex, physical activity, smoking, etc. 

>- Can measure <span class="alert">changes</span> in segregation intensity in neighborhood of origin and destination for people who have moved.

>- Have to be sure that people who moved are <span class="alert">not systematically different</span> from those who didn't.

# Higher intensity of segregation <span class="alert">$\to$</span> higher blood pressure.
 
>- People who moved from a high- to lower-segregation context experienced small but meaningful decreases in blood pressure. 

>- Suggests that policies facilitating neighborhood mobility could have positive health effects.

>- Reliance on SBP as a <span class="alert">proxy</span> for CVD is a limitation, but a common one when the outcome is relatively rare and the effect is subtle - even if it is important.

# Doing better work on structural racism requires <span class="alert">creativity</span> 

> We must think beyond our training, statistical tests, and practices that dismiss methodologies that we may be unfamiliar with. There is scholarship being overlooked that proposes new approaches we could explore..., <span class="alert">but we cannot move forward with capturing variables like structural racism if we do not explore our creativity</span>. (From Adkins-Jackson 2021)

# Time to <span class="alert">grapple</span> with the complexity of social-spatial relationships in our own work

>- The spatial expression of social inequality is complex.

>- Our measures are necessarily <span class="alert">reductive</span>, and that's OK...

>- <span class="alert">IF and only IF</span> (âŸº) we use these measures carefully without losing sight of the mechanisms and outcomes we care about.

>- Lets spend some time making sense of these ideas using [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOHe4agI=/?invite_link_id=546695231041).
