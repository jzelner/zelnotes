# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/merlo_sim_data.png">

How can we characterize the relative importance of <span class="alert">individual</span> vs. <span class="alert">contextual</span> drivers of variation?

# Agenda

>- Review the concept of <span class="alert">intraclass correlation</span>

>- Set goals for in-class workshop on 3/31


# What is intraclass correlation?

>- A measure of <span class="alert">global</span> clustering.

>- Measures the amount of the <span class="alert">total variance</span> in an outcome that is clustered within vs. between <span class="alert">groups</span>

>- Groups can include households, neighborhoods, cities, etc.

>- ICC is useful when there is individual-level and spatial variation but it is not clear which is <span class="alert">most important</span>

# What is variance?

>- <span class="alert">Square</span> of the average deviation from the mean

>- So, if standard deviation: $\sigma$ = 10$, Variance: $\sigma^2$ = 100.

# The total variance is the <span class="alert">sum</span> of the within- and between-group variances

$$
\sigma^2_{Total}=\sigma^2_N+\sigma^2_I
$$

- $\sigma^2_N$ = \alert{Between-neighborhood} variance in outcomes.

- $\sigma^2_I$ = Individual level variance in outcomes (\alert{within-neighborhood} variation)

# We can then use these to calculate the ICC

$$
ICC=\frac{\sigma_{N}^2}{\sigma_{N}^2+\sigma_{I}^2}
$$

In words: the ICC is the proportion of the total variation in the outcome that occurs *within* the units we care about.

# A simple worked example {.imgslie}

<img src="../examples/icc/output/ind_sbp_hist.png">

500 observations of blood pressure with $\bar{x}$ = 120, $\sigma^2$ = 8

# Plotting by neighborhood shows that there is more than just <span class="alert">individual</span> variation {.imgslide}

<img src="../examples/icc/output/ind_sbp_means.png">

# Use <span class="alert">neighborhood means</span> to estimate between-neighborhood variance

<img src="../examples/icc/output/ind_neigh_sbp_means.png">

# We can use this information to calculate the ICC

>- Total Variance = 8

>- Neighborhood Variance = 3

>- Individual Variance = Total - Neighborhood = 5

>- ICC = $\frac{\text{individual variance}}{\text{total variance}}$ = .375

# What does that mean?

>- About 38% of variation in SBP outcomes is attributable to neighborhood.

>- Seems like a lot, but importance is ultimately relative to the what biological and public health mechanisms are of interest.

>- Provides a <span class="alert">basis for comparison</span> with other locations.

# Preparing for <span class="alert">What route will you take?</span> workshop

>- Why are we doing this?

>- How should you prepare?

# Effective <span class="alert">communication</span> of spatial questions and analyses is central to the goals of this course.

>- Identify well-posed spatial problems in public health and epidemiology.

>- Articulate concrete, informed, goals for spatially-focused public health interventions and research.

>- Suggest appropriate theoretical and analytic frameworks for understanding spatial variation in public health problems and interventions and policies meant to ameliorate them.

# Since these are <span class="alert">difficult</span> and <span class="alert">complex</span> problems, good feedback is essential to getting your message across {.imgslide}

What does this trolley have to do with feedback? Let me tell you a story...

# What does helpful feedback <span class="alert">do</span>? {.imgslide}

<img src= "../images/feedback_loop_example.jpg">

Generate insights that facilitate <span class="alert">improvement</span> or <span class="alert">growth</span> in the topic at hand

# What makes for <span class="alert">helpful</span> feedback?

>- Take the perspective of a peer or member of the intended audience who wants to learn about the topic, rather than a teacher/evaluator with an interest in finding <span class="alert">flaws</span>.

>- Start by really trying to understand what your partner is <span class="alert">trying to acheive</span>. 

>- Be <span class="alert">specific</span> in your feedback and keep it close to the paper you're reading.

>- Ask questions: If something doesn't make sense, explain what about it is confusing and ask what they were trying to accomplish. 

>- Flag things you find interesting as well as those that are unclear. Knowing what is working is as or <span class="alert">more</span> important than knowing what isn't.

>- Suggest resources or ideas that might help your partner advance their project.
