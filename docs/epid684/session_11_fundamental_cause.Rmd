# Agenda

>- Wrap up clustering mind-mapping exercise from Monday.
>- What is the <span class="alert">fundamental cause</span> perspective and how does it relate to spatial epidemiology?
>- Between-city and cross-national comparison of the impact of segregation on low birthweight.
>- How can we measure <span class="alert">spatial segregation</span>?


# Speaking of <span class="alert">fallacies...

# What is the <span class="alert">fundamental cause</span> approach?

>- Theoretical perspective on the generation of health inequalities as a function of high-level risks like <span class="alert">socioeconomic status</span> (SES) as well as racial discrimination, social stigma, and residential segregation.

>- Focuses on how upstream determinants put individuals <span class="alert">at risk of risks</span>.

>- Important for understanding spatially <span class="alert">clustered</span> health outcomes and inequalities. 

# What makes SES a fundamental cause?

>- Reflects differential access to <span style="color: green;">money</span>, information and social <span class="alert">power</span>.
>- Impacts <span class="alert">multiple</span> more-proximal risks for disease.
>- Likely to drive risk across <span class="alert">multiple</span> health outcomes.
>- Association persists even when a <span class="alert">proximal mechanism</span> is no longer associated with SES.

# Why is racism as a fundamental cause <span class="alert">in addition</span> to SES?  {.imgslide}

<div class="fragment"><img src="../images/phelan_link_residential.png">

Why can't <span class="alert">socioeconomic status</span> explain all of this association?</div>

# Racism has many impacts on health that <span class="alert">go beyond and modify</span> SES

>- Differential quality of medical treatment.

>- Differential access to health-promoting environments.

>- Employment and housing discrimination. 

>- Emotional and physical stress resulting from prolonged exposure to discrimination.

# Racial residential segregation reflects <span class="alert">spatial clustering of risk</span> caused by racism. {.imgslide}

What does segregation <span class="alert">do</span> in the generation of health inequalities?

# How does the impact of <span class="alert">segregation</span> on birth outcomes vary between cities and countries?

>- How do DeMaio et al. measure segregation in Toronto and Chicago? What do you think of this metric?
>- How does the impact of residential segregation on LBW vary between the U.S. cities and Toronto?

<div class="fragment"><span class="alert">Isolation</span>: defined as the proportion of contacts an individual in a minority group in a population has with a member of that same group.</div>

# Sometimes paired with the <span class="alert">interaction</span> index

Interaction quantifies the proportion of minority group member's contacts that occur with the majority group.

# What are these indices used for? 

>- Quantify the *intensity* of contact between groups, e.g. as in residential segregation. 

>- Measure exposure of potentially infectious individuals to susceptible individuals.

>- Describe the distribution of plant species across a geographic area.

# How do you measure <span class="alert">isolation</span> ?

$$
Z = \sum_{i} \frac{a_{i}}{A} \frac{a_{i}}{n_i}
$$

Where:

- $a_i$: Number of minority  members in area $i$
- $b_i$: Number of majority group members in area $i$
- $A$ total number of minority group members
- $B$ total number of majority group members, where $A < B$.
- $n_i$ number individuals in area $i$, i.e. $a_i + b_i$

# How do you measure <span class="alert">interaction</span>?

$$
Z = \sum_{i} \frac{a_{i}}{A} \frac{b_{i}}{n_i}
$$

Where:

- $a_i$: Number of minority  members in area $i$
- $b_i$: Number of majority group members in area $i$
- $A$ total number of minority group members
- $B$ total number of majority group members, where $A < B$.
- $n_i$ number individuals in area $i$, i.e. $a_i + b_i$


# Reflects <span class="alert">qualitative</span> differences in contact {.imgslide}

<img src ="../examples/output/motif/iso_2.pdf">

As concentration of minority group increases, isolation does as well

# What happens when we induce more separation?

<img src = "../examples/output/motif/iso_3.pdf">

# Isolation is <span class="alert">density dependent</span> {.imgslide}

<img src ="../examples/output/motif/iso_1.pdf">

When individuals are randomly distributed, isolation equals the <span class="alert">minority share</span> of the population.

# <span style="color: red"> A problem:</span> Isolation ignores spatial structure

<img src = "../examples/output/motif/iso_2.pdf">


# <span class="alert">Randomizing</span> locations doesn't change isolation

<img src = "../examples/output/motif/iso_2_random.pdf">

# Is this really a good representation...

<img src="../examples/output/motif/iso_3_random.pdf">

# Of this?

<img src="../examples/output/motif/iso_3.pdf">

# A useful metric...with some drawbacks

>- Isolation tells us something that may be <span class="alert">qualitatively important</span>

>- A good fit for a range of epidemiological and social problems

>- Limited by lack of information about <span class="alert">spatial structure
</span>

>- Choice of <span class="alert">spatial units</span> is critical for interpretation
