## Agenda 

- Overview of the Roadmap project

- Tobler's first law and other words to live by

- Road-testing project topics with insights from Tobler, Miller and Goodchild

## The "First Law" of Geography

    "Everything is related to everything else. But near things are more related than distant things."

## What makes the first law useful? 

>"[I]magine a world in which [TFL] is not true. In such a world, the full range of conditions could be encountered in every minute portion of the world. Every room, for example, might contain the <span class="alert">full observed range of the Earth‚Äôs topographic variation</span>, from the bottom of the Marianas Trench to the summit of Mount Everest[.] [@goodchild2004, p.301]

## No first law $\to$ "A world of white noise" 

!["White noise", like TV static, is characterized by high variation but minimal autocorrelation.](../images/tv_static.jpeg)

## But wait...there's more!

Goodchild argues that:

- *Variation* is more fundamental than *autocorrelation*.

- Without spatial variation there is only perfect autocorrelation.

- Maybe the omnipresence of *variation* should be the First Law?

- Doesn't discount role of <span class="alert">correlation</span>, just puts them in order.

## How do these 'laws' relate to your own interests?

In a few minutes I'll ask you to:

- Think about the epidemiological system you want to focus on for your project.

- What kinds of mechanisms do you think are important as drivers of spatial *variation*? 

- How about <span class="alert">clustering</span>?

- At what <span class="alert">scales</span> are these patterns likely to emerge?

# Different <span class="alert">mechanisms</span> ‚öôÔ∏è play out at different spatial scales

## Global patterns of malaria are likely to be impacted by climate change

## Differences in accesibility to HIV care across Sub-Saharan Africa reflect local and regional variation epidemiological conditions and policies

## ‚ö° Jump-starting the roadmap project ‚ö°

For the balance of the time today:

- Think about which epidemiological systems you are interested in focusing on for your project.

- What kinds of mechanisms do you think are important as drivers of spatial *variation* in these systems?

- How about <span class="alert">clustering</span> or spatial <span class="alert">autocorrelation</span>?

- At what <span class="alert">scales</span> are these patterns likely to emerge? 

## Next Time

- Stay tuned!
