# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/broad_street_pump.jpg">

What actually caused the end of the Golden Square outbreak?


# Agenda

>- Wrapping up *The Ghost Map*
>- <span class="alert">Smoothing</span> hands-on.

# Consilience!

> <span class="alert">The strength of [Snow's] model derived from its ability to use observed phenomena on one scale to make predictions about behavior on other scales up and down the chain.</span>" Observed failure of certain organ systems of the body could predict behavior of the whole person, which could in turn predict behavior in the social body en masse." (p. 148)

<p class="fragment" style="text-align: center;">What might be a bit off about this pronouncement?</p>

# Some Questions

Take <span class="alert">10m</span> in small groups:

>- What was the most likely route by which cholera was introduced to the Broad Street Pump?
>- Why didn't the outbreak spread <span class="alert">exponentially</span>?
>- What is the most plausible explanation for why the outbreak ended?

# More <span class="alert">miasma</span> debunking

> [Snow's] experience with choloform and ether had also endowed [him] with an intuitive grasp of the way that gases disperse in the environment. Ether could be deadly in a concentrated form, delivered directly to the patientâ€™s lungs. <span class="alert">But a doctor delivering it, standing a foot away from the patient, wouldnâ€™t feel its effects in the slightest, because the density of ether molecules in the air dropped at a precipitous rate the farther removed one was from the inhaler itself.</span>  (p.145)

# Putting the <span class="alert">mechanism</span> on the map

<div class="toprow">
  <div style="flex:70%"><blockquote style="font-size: 0.6em;">"In his mind snow was already drawing maps. heâ€™d imagined an overview of the Golden Square neighborhood, with a <span class="alert">boundary line running an erratic circle around the Broad Street pump.</span> Every person inside that border lived closer to the poisoned well; everyone outside would have had reason to draw water from a different source." (p. 141)</blockquote></div>
  <div class="textcolumn"><ul>
      <li class="fragment">10 cases outside the boundary.</li>
      <li class="fragment">2 were tailor & son on Cross st.</li>
      <li class="fragment">3 were children who went to school near the pump.</li>
      <li class="fragment">3 more regularly drank from the pump.</li>
      <li class="fragment">2 more could be chalked up to the typical toll of Cholera in a given weekend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
</div>

# Scale, scale, scale

> "If the symptoms of the cholera concentrated around the small intestine, then there must be some telltale characteristic in the eating and drinking habits of cholera victims. If cholera was waterborne, then the patterns of infection must correlate with the patterns of water distribution in London's neighborhoods." (p. 148)

# Strength of Snow's explanation rested on <span class="alert">nuts and bolts</span> analysis.

>- Cesspool in the basement of 40 Broad was the source of the outbreak. 
>- Others got sick in 40 Broad over the course of the week, so why did they not add additional fuel to the ðŸ”¥?
>- Only the Lewis family had access to the basement cesspool, while others threw their waste out the...ðŸªŸ.
