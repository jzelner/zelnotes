# The "First Law" of Geography {.quote .center}

# Why is the first law useful? {.quote .center}

<figure>
<blockquote>
"[I]magine a world in which [TFL] is not true. In such a world, the full range of conditions could be encountered in every minute portion of the world. Every room, for example, might contain the full observed range of the Earthâ€™s topographic variation, from the bottom of the Marianas Trench to the summit of Mount Everest[.]

## "A world of white noise" {.imgslide}

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="TV white noise"}
include_local_graphics("images/tv_static.jpeg")
```

"White noise" has lots of variation with little autocorrelation.

# More to the story?

Goodchild argues that:

>- *Variation* is more fundamental than *autocorrelation*.
>- Without spatial variation there is only perfect autocorrelation.
>- Maybe *variation* needs to be the real First Law?
>- Doesn't discount role of correlation, just puts them in order.


# Spatial autocorrelation + variation in the real world {.imgslide .r-fit-text}

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
#|fig.cap="Measles cases in Texarkana, Tex and Texarkana, Ark in 1970"
include_local_graphics("images/texarkana_measles.png")
```
Outbreaks of measles in two cities with very different vaccination coverages.

# {.imgslide}
<h1 class="r-fit-text">Characterizing autocorrelation and variation is tricky</h1>
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', fig.align="center", fig.cap="Checkerboard-like example of high spatial autocorrelation"}
include_local_graphics("images/morans_i_example.png")
```
Using a measure like *Moran's I* this is perfectly correlated, but we can see qualitatively that there is more going on.

# Some Questions 

Take 3m on your own:

>- Think about the epidemiological system you want to focus on for your project.
>- What kinds of mechanisms do you think are important for driving *variation* in this system?
>- How about clustering and autocorrelation?
>- Are these mechanisms more *local* or more *global*?

<p class="fragment fade-up"> Pair up and discuss for 5m.</p>

# Return of "Good Map, Bad Map"

- Activity [description](https://notes.epibayes.net/Courses/EPID684/Activities/Good+Map%2C+Bad+Map)

- [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KJTB9Nq4S4J6aZLtjv0xTADWhEl83nuqX0KP56k8QrY/edit?usp=sharing) 

- Spend 10m finishing up slides and then come back to share.
