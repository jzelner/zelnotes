# Agenda 

>- Final "Good Map, Bad Map" presentations.
>- What makes for a spatial systems approach to epidemiology?
>- Mapping your own project topics as spatial systems.

# Return of "Good Map, Bad Map"

- [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KJTB9Nq4S4J6aZLtjv0xTADWhEl83nuqX0KP56k8QrY/edit?usp=sharing) 

# Why take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on spatial epidemiology? 

>- If we care about the effect of place, isolating individual risk factors may be counterproductive.
>- Determinants of health and disparities accure over the <span class="alert">lifecourse</span> and have to be understood cumulatively.
>- We might be able to identify the causes of "policy resistance" and ways around them.

## Relative roles of people and places {.quote}

<blockquote>
"Although many studies have documented important differences in neighborhood physical and social environments by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic position, the extent to which these neighborhood differences contribute to disparities in health has remained elusive. <span class="alert">This elusiveness may in part be a result of the virtually exclusive analytical focus on isolating the effects of context and composition.</span> A crucial need is a more nuanced understanding of how the linked processes of residential segregation, differential location of health-related resources, and the behaviors of residents dynamically affect health differentials."
</blockquote>

From Diez Roux et al. 2011

# How can we <span class="alert">apply</span> the systems perspective?
<div class="toprow">
<div class="column" style="flex:60%">
>- Characterize system components or states.
>- Figure out which are the most important <span class="alert">relationships</span>.
>- Create a model of the system that lets you look at the implications of these relationships.

# A spatial systems perspective on your <span class="alert">problem</span> topic. 

Spend 15m on your own: 

>- Thinking through the components of your system.
>- Characterizing the <span class="alert">relationships</span> between these components.
>- Diagramming out these relationships using the approach from the Diez Roux et al. paper.
>- Focus on *simplicity*, i.e. if you don't think it needs to be there...it doesn't!

<p class = "fragment">Spend 20m in small groups comparing the workings of your systems.</p>

# Spatial systems (of systems) {.center .sectionbreak}

# Working with complex systems means dealing with <span class="alert">messes</span>.

<img src="./mess_management.png">

## A mess is a systems of systems. {.quote}

<blockquote>
"What we do experience are large and complex sets of interacting problems, dynamic systems of problems... [W]e refer to these as messes. Our focus is on the <span class = "alert">management</span> of messes rather than the solution of problems. Mess management requires planning, not problem solving.
</blockquote>

From Ackoff 1981, "The Art and Science of Mess Management"

## Approaches to mess management.

>1. *Clinical:* Holistic and diagnostic in nature; takes in the whole mess without a theory of how it fits together.

>2. *Research:* Focused on breaking down the *mess* into minimally-interacting constituent parts and solving each as an independent problem.

>3. *Design:* Adaptive & iterative and combines the more holistic clinical approach that is continually updated with research findings. 


## Can be thought about in terms of the problem of <span class="alert">scale</span>. {.imgslide}

<img src= "../images/connected_outbreaks.png">

How many outbreaks we see is really a function of what scale we're looking at or care about.
