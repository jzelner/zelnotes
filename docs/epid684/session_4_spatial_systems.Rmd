# Spatial systems (of systems) in epidemiology {#title}

# Agenda 

>- Final "Good Map, Bad Map" presentations.
>- What makes for a spatial systems approach to epidemiology?
>- Mapping your own project topics as spatial systems.

# Return of "Good Map, Bad Map"

# Why take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on epidemiology? 

>- If we care about the effect of place, isolating individual risk factors may be counterproductive.
>- Determinants of health and disparities accure over the <span class="alert">lifecourse</span> and have to be understood cumulatively.
>- We might be able to identify the causes of "policy resistance" and ways around them.

## Relative roles of people and places {.quote}

<blockquote>
"Although many studies have documented important differences in neighborhood physical and social environments by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic position, the extent to which these neighborhood differences contribute to disparities in health has remained elusive. <span class="alert">This elusiveness may in part be a result of the virtually exclusive analytical focus on isolating the effects of context and composition.</span> A crucial need is a more nuanced understanding of how the linked processes of residential segregation, differential location of health-related resources, and the behaviors of residents dynamically affect health differentials."
</blockquote>

How many outbreaks we see is really a function of what scale we're looking at or care about.

# A systems perspective on your <span class="alert">problem</span> topic. 

Spend 15m on your own: 

>- Thinking through the components of your system.
>- Characterizing the <span class="alert">relationships</span> between these components.
>- Diagramming out these relationships using the approach from the Diez Roux et al. paper.
>- Focus on *simplicity*, i.e. if you don't think it needs to be there...it doesn't!

<p class = "fragment">Spend 10m in pairs explaining the working of your systems.</p>
