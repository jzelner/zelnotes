The struggle is real. 🥶

# Agenda

>- What is <span class="alert">clustering</span>?
>- What is a <span style="color: red">hotspot</span> 🔥, anyway?.
>- Interrogating the hotspot and cluster ideas with respect to your projects.

# <span class="alert">Why</span> might one undertake a cluster-based study?

>- Public Health Response.
>- Hypothesis testing.
>- Identifying key <span class="alert">causal mechansisms</span>.

# Reasoning about clusters is <span class="alert">tricky</span> {.imgslide}

The Texas Sharpshooter 🎯 Problem is an example of a <span class="alert">logical fallacy</span> that can come up in the analysis of spatial clusters.

# What is a <span style="color: red">hotspot</span>? {.imgslide}

# More detail is necessary to make the hotspot concept useful

> We recommend that the meaning of a “hotspot” be made *explicit* by use of an appropriate modifier such as: “burden hotspot,” to denote areas of elevated disease prevalence or incidence; “transmission” or “risk hotspot,” to denote areas of elevated transmission efficiency or a higher risk of disease acquisition; and “emergence hotspot,” to denote areas with an increased probability of disease emergence or reemergence. (Lessler et al., 2017)

# A cluster can represent multiple facets 💎 of risk

>- Spatial aggregation of a disease <span class="alert">outcome</span>.
>- Clustering of a specific <span class="alert">exposure risk</span>.
>- Evidence of <span class="alert">social processes</span> that concentrate disadvantage and multiple risks.

# Our Turn!

Relate the hotspot/clustering metaphors to your <span class="alert">project topic area</span> with respect to:
