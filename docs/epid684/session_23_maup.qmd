## Agenda

- Defining the <span style="color:red">MAUP</span> ðŸ˜± and the challenges it presents.

- Implications of looking at the same phenomena over different scales.

- Return of smoothing (if we have time...)

## What are some of the ways to <span class="alert">define</span> neighborhoods?

Administrative neighborhoods
: Census tracts, block groups, official neighborhoods

Residential neighborhoods
: Boundary definitions that reflect characteristic patterns of movement and exposure for people living in a given area

Egocentric neighborhoods
: Defined <span class="alert">relative to the individual's location</span>, may incorporate patterns of movement and exposure specific to them.

## <span class="alert">Scale</span> Effects {.imgslide}

Different neighborhood <span class="alert">boundaries</span> at the same scale result in different estimates of local N0<sub>2</sub> exposure. [@parenteau2011]
:::

## <span class="alert">Administrative boundaries</span> are very important for characterizing variation in policy-related outcomes

## Environmental exposures like <span class="alert">air pollution</span> do not respect administrative boundaries

## What does any of this have to do with <span class="alert">me</span>?

Take 5-10m to <span class="alert">identify</span> using this [miro board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/OEo2U0VDVkpiamhseVdMN243NTJHVkVpdk9iU0ZZSk1OeEJMQ09nell0NDE1aXpKUkMzRFBWbldMdXl0YWVmcXwzMDc0NDU3MzUwNDM2MzA5MTQx?invite_link_id=606920066591):

- What are potential <span class="alert">zonation effects</span> for your project topic?

- How about <span class="alert">scale effects</span>?

## Why should we be concerned about the <span class="alert">tyrrany of neighborhoods</span>? {.imgslide}

Not all exposures happen at a single scale (From [@petrovic2020])
:::
## A thought experiment about <span class="alert">scales</span>

- Use individual-level data from Australian cities to examine correspondence between individual and neighborhood avg. wealth.

- Build <span class="alert">bespoke</span> or egocentric neighborhoods around each location of increasing size. 

- Examine how the relationship between neighborhood average and individual incomes change with increasing size.

- Not looking for the <span class="alert">right</span> scale, but instead for the implications of using each.

## What happens to <span class="alert">variation</span> in income as the scale of neighborhoods <span class="alert">increases</span>? {.imgslide}

## Petrovic et al. advocate a <span class="alert">multi-scale</span> approach

- Higher-order structures constrain possibilities within lower-level ones. 

- The timescale of change at higher (e.g. city or region) levels is slower than at more-local levels. 

- What advantages do you see in taking a multi-scale approach to your problem?

- What are the practical and theoretical challenges to doing so?
