# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

Mental models, past and <span class="alert">present</span>

# Agenda

>- Bringing the lessons of *The Ghost Map* into the present.
>- <span class="alert">Smoothing</span> in two dimensions.

# History repeats itself

> In this paper, I have argued that both the long delays in replacing flawed, miasma-driven approaches to cholera prevention in the nineteenth century and long delays in replacing an exclusively contact-and-droplet model of SARS-CoV-2 prevention with one that includes airborne transmission in the twenty-first both had a philosophical explanation in terms of which mental models of reality prevailed and the extent to which scientists and policymakers favoured <span class="alert">data over theory</span>. (Greenlagh 2021)

# Small <span class="alert">scale</span> data provided compelling evidence for the droplet theory of SARS-CoV-2 transmission {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/cdc_choir_practice.jpg">

Does this echo anything from *The Ghost Map*?

# Why didn't <span class="alert">mechanistic</span> evidence dislodge the droplet-only perspective? {.imgslide}

# Theory shapes our approach to <span class="alert">data</span>

    <li class="fragment">Explore the implications of spatially varying policies.</li>

    Intuition pumps are cunningly designed [thought experiments, which] <span class="alert">focus the reader's attention on "the important"

# Democratized spatial analysis can foster more progressive <span class="alert">mental models</span>.

> In addressing the "mechanisms of life" in relation to epidemic occurrence, popular access to [spatial] incidence data, coupled with socioeconomic data, is not only democratizing but as a result encourages <span class="alert">public critiques of governmental responses to epidemic events and the socioeconomic conditions that influence their intensity</span>. (Koch 2021)

# But: A geographic perspective does not automatically foster <span class="alert">equity</span>

> Granularity of data allows more finegrained analyses, including multilevel spatial modeling. But presented by themselves, such granular data can reinforce what the sociologist Loïc Wacquant has dubbed “territorial stigmatization,” whereby <span class="alert"> resource-deprived neighborhoods suffer from “blemish of place”</span> and are thought to be “composed essentially of poor people, minorities and foreigners,” many of whom have already been marginalized by the broader society. (Chowkwanyun & Reed, 2020)

# Data accessibility $\ne$ Data equality 

> While democratizing the result is not universally democratic. An ability to access the data depends on internet access which is not yet universal. Even with that access, manipulation of the data requires cartographic and statistical programs that, while increasingly available at low cost, are neither free nor intuitive. <span class="alert">Nor is there any guarantee that alternate interpretations and critical studies will be broadly disseminated.</span> (Koch 2021)
