# Agenda

>- <span class="alert">Final project</span> timeline
>- Discussing the <span class="alert">laws of health geography</span>
>- Hands-on <span class="alert">smoothing</span> activity

# Final Project

>- Final form of your project is <span class="alert">up to you</span>.
>- Please feel free to continue with your 592 topic if that is of interest! 
>- Weekly project checkpoints are there to make sure you are able to make progress in the (<span class="alert">limited</span>) time we have.
>- Ultimately, I want you to do what is most <span class="alert">useful</span> and interesting for you.

# The "First Law" of Geography {.quote .center}

# Why is the first law useful? {.quote .center}

<figure>
<blockquote>
"[I]magine a world in which [TFL] is not true. In such a world, the full range of conditions could be encountered in every minute portion of the world. <span class="alert">Every room, for example, might contain the full observed range of the Earthâ€™s topographic variation, from the bottom of the Marianas Trench to the summit of Mount Everest[.]</span>

## "A world of white noise" {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/tv_static.png" width="100%">

"White noise" has lots of variation with little autocorrelation.

# More to the story?

Goodchild argues that:

>- *Variation* is more fundamental than *autocorrelation*.
>- Without spatial variation there is only perfect autocorrelation.
>- Maybe *variation* needs to be the real First Law?
>- Doesn't discount role of correlation, just puts them in order.

# Spatial autocorrelation + variation in the real world {.imgslide .r-fit-text}

# What is <span class="alert">smoothing</span>?

<p style="text-align: center;"> Smoothing lets us separate signal from noise.</p>
</div>

# What are some examples of epidemiological <span class="alert">signals</span>?

>- Causal <span class="alert">relationship</span> between a risk factor and an outcome.
>- Trend in a <span class="alert">time series</span>
>- Disease <span class="alert">hotspot</span> in a spatial dataset.

# What are some sources of <span class="alert">noise</span> we might encounter in epidemiological data?

>- Random variation, i.e. <span class="alert">process noise</span>.
>- Observation <span class="alert">error</span>.
>- Exposure <span class="alert">misclassification</span>.

# A hands-on example

Using a measure like *Moran's I* this is <span class="alert">anti</span>- correlated, but we can see qualitatively that there is more going on.
