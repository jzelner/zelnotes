## Agenda

- How can dynamic models help us better understand the implications of <span class="alert">Infectious Fear</span>?

- Hands-on activity exploring <span class="alert">mechanistic</span> relationships between segregation and infectious disease transmission.

- What to expect in our in-class presentation workshop on Monday.

## Logistics:

- Presenting 10/26: Malaria ü¶ü, Plague üêÄ, MRSA ü¶†, Monkeypox ü¶†

- Presenting ü¶á 10/31 üéÉ: Bacterial STIs ü¶†, Pediatric Diarrheal disease ü¶†, Polio üíâ

- Plan on presenting for ~20m including Q&A

- If you have slides etc. please send to me ahead of time so I can load up on üñ•Ô∏è.

# What are we talking about when we talk about <span class="alert">epidemiological models</span>?

## {.imgslide}

<h1 style="font-size:1.5em"><span class="alert">Models and modelers</span> have been key to COVID-19 response</h1>

## Modeling has become a key element of pandemic <span class="alert">preparedness</span>. {.imgslide}

<blockquote>"Pandemic preparedness is a continuous process of planning, exercising, revising and translating into action national and
sub-national pandemic preparedness and response plans. A pandemic plan is thus a <span class="alert">living document</span> which is reviewed regularly and revised if necessary...based on the lessons learnt from outbreaks or a pandemic, or from a
simulation exercise."</blockquote>

## What does an <span class="alert">epidemiological model</span> do?

- Represent explicit ideas about how transmission <span class="alert">systems</span> work.

- Define interactons between <span class="alert">system components</span>.

- Explore the relative contributions of <span class="alert">individual</span>, <span class="alert">spatial</span>, and <span class="alert">social/environmental</span> relationships to population-level risks.

- Ask questions about alternative social, political and medical <span class="alert">futures</span>.

- Ultimately: Let us take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on infectious diseases.

## Are these tools relevant for understanding the <span class="alert">social history</span> of infection?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

-  What kind of social/structural mechanisms are likely to be important drivers of <span class="alert">variation</span> in these risks?

- If we built a transmission model based on Infectious Fear, what might it be useful for?

- In the present day?

- For better understanding history?

## What does it mean to take a <span class="alert">systems perspective</span> on socio-historical epidemiology?

- <span class="alert">On your own:</span> What are the <span class="alert">key components</span> of the epidemiological system described in <span class="alert">Infectious Fear</span>? (5m)

- <span class="alert">In groups of 3-4:</span> Compare the components you defined and diagram out your representation of that system, drawing on the ideas in the Acevedo-Garcia et al. paper (10m)

- Pair up with another group, compare your diagrams and discuss who - if anyone - might find a model like this useful. (10m)

## Time to go hands-on

## Next Time

- Proposal presentation workshop!

- Come ready to work on your presentations.

- Will do an exercise at the beginning to help plan out the rest of your project.

- Kelly and I will check in with groups during class and help troubleshoot.
