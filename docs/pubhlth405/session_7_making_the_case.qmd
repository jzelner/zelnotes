## What happened in the 1849 <span class="alert">Thomas street outbreak</span> that drove these ideas home for Snow?

:::{.fragment}
> "Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around shared water supplies. <span class="alert">If the miasma theory were right, why would it draw such arbitrary distinctions?</span> Why would the cholera devastate one building but leave the one next door unscathed? Why would one slum suffer twice the losses as a slum with arguably worse sanitary conditions?" (Johnson, p.74)

<h1 style="font-size: 3em; color: white; -webkit-text-stroke:2px black">The Grand Experiment</h1>

## What was the *experimentum crucis*?

- Snow took advantage of changes in infrastructure to compare neighborhoods served with contaminated and clean water.

- Example of a natural experiment.

- Exploits some kind of random variation in exposure to make causal inferences where they would otherwise not be possible.

- What are some other examples of a natural experiment?


## Changes in London water service provided an opportunity for Snow
<div class="toprow">
  <div class="textcolumn">
  <ul>
  <li>Around 1850, parliament mandated that all water companies move their intake beyond the <span class="alert">outflow of the Thames by 1855</span></li>
  <li class="fragment">In south London there were two major water suppliers: Southwark & Vauxhall (S&V) and Lambeth.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Lambeth moved the intake up in 1852, but S&V waited until 1855.</li>

    <p style="font-size: 0.5em">Snow's Water Supply Map</p></div>
</div>

## Snow's map of water suppliers

<img src="../images/snow_water_map.jpg">

## Conducting the grand experiment

- Snow divided data into sub-districts of South London organized by water supplier.

- 12 were served by only S&V, 3 by Lambeth alone

- <span class="alert">1/100</span> people died of Cholera in S&V only districts, but none among the > 14K living in Lambeth districts

## What made the Grand Experiment <span class="alert">inconclusive</span>?

-  16 sub-districts were served by both suppliers

- Within these districts, water service was overlapping at a fine scale.

- Snow went door-to-door...but people living in these districts often had no idea where their water came from.

- So, he collected water from them and tried to find evidence of the causal agent of Cholera in the sample

# <span class="alert">The Pump!</span> {data-background-image="../images/broad_street_pump.jpg"} 

## Snow searched for exceptions that prove the rule to convince skeptics

> Snow knew that the case would be made in the exceptions to the rule. What he needed now were aberrations, deviations from the norm. <span class="alert">Pockets of life where you would expect death, pockets of death where you would expect life.</span>  (p.140)


## Snow's experience with anesthesia contributed to his <span class="alert">miasma</span> debunking

> [Snow's] experience with choloform and ether had also endowed [him] with an intuitive grasp of the way that gases disperse in the environment. Ether could be deadly in a concentrated form, delivered directly to the patientâ€™s lungs. <span class="alert">But a doctor delivering it, standing a foot away from the patient, wouldnâ€™t feel its effects in the slightest, because the density of ether molecules in the air dropped at a precipitous rate the farther removed one was from the inhaler itself.</span>  (p.145)

## In your groups from last time: What happened, exactly, in Golden Square?

- What was the most likely route by which cholera was introduced to the Broad Street Pump?

- Why didn't the outbreak spread <span class="alert">exponentially</span>?

- What is the most plausible explanation for why the outbreak ended?

## Return of the Diagram!

![We will continue to use this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPWBomlk=/?share_link_id=219375095326) to connect Snow's pre-1854 explorations to the 1854 outbreak](../images/20220916111609.png)  


## Put the <span class="alert">mechanism</span> on the map

<div class="toprow">
  <div style="flex:70%"><blockquote style="font-size: 0.6em;">"In his mind snow was already drawing maps. heâ€™d imagined an overview of the Golden Square neighborhood, with a <span class="alert">boundary line running an erratic circle around the Broad Street pump.</span> Every person inside that border lived closer to the poisoned well; everyone outside would have had reason to draw water from a different source." (p. 141)</blockquote></div>
  <div class="textcolumn"><ul>
      <li class="fragment">10 cases outside the boundary.</li>
      <li class="fragment">2 were tailor & son on Cross st.</li>
      <li class="fragment">3 were children who went to school near the pump.</li>
      <li class="fragment">3 more regularly drank from the pump.</li>
      <li class="fragment">2 more could be chalked up to the typical toll of Cholera in a given weekend.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
</div>

## Scale, scale, scale (again!)

> "If the symptoms of the cholera concentrated around the small intestine, then there must be some telltale characteristic in the eating and drinking habits of cholera victims. <span class="alert">If cholera was waterborne, then the patterns of infection must correlate with the patterns of water distribution in London's neighborhoods.</span>" (p. 148)

## Strength of Snow's explanation rested on <span class="alert">nuts and bolts</span> analysis.

- Cesspool in the basement of 40 Broad was the source of the outbreak. 

- Others got sick in 40 Broad over the course of the week, so why did they not add additional fuel to the ðŸ”¥?

- Only the Lewis family had access to the basement cesspool, while others threw their waste out the...ðŸªŸ.
