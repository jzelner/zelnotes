## Dugas became a starring character in "And the Band Played On"

> Worried that the mainstream media might not give coverage to Shilts’s popular history, his editor at St. Martin’s Press, Michael Denneny, approved a bold publicity strategy. He focused on Shilts’s identification of Dugas as “Patient Zero” and the flight attendant’s <span class="alert">conflicts with physicians and public health officials</span>, sensing that the salacious story the journalist had created would prove irresistible. (From [@mckay2014])

## Conservative and mainstream media focus on him as a villain

> His hunch was accurate: the New York Post’s headline on October 6, 1987, epitomized the media’s response and characterized the popular memory of Gaétan Dugas from that point on. “the man who gave us aids” read the front page, claiming that Dugas “triggered ‘gay cancer’ epidemic in U.S.”76 Other publications drew upon the frequently rehearsed narrative of a disease introduced from abroad by a foreigner. “Canadian Said to Have Had Key Role in Spread of AIDS,” wrote the New York Times, while the National Review nicknamed Dugas “the Columbus of AIDS." [@mckay2014]

## The narrative goes <span class="alert">mainstream</span>

## Genomic data have thoroughly debunked the 'Patient 0' idea about HIV
