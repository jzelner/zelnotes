## Agenda

- Reflecting on *Fiasco* as a whole

- What is <span class="alert">harm reduction</span> and why is it so controversial?

- "How to Hide a Plague"

- Time to incorporate feedback from presentations

## How do we go from a pandemic to an endemic disease? (~9m)

## Fiasco has taken us from the emergence of HIV to its managment as a chronic, <span class="alert">endemic</span> infection

In the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHtIa94D2avmCJQkTfzcLYkj-IEQX28dKpA2ncio4AI/edit): 

- What surprised or struck you the most in the final episode, "No Harm"?

- What is your biggest takeaway from listening to the series as a whole?

- What do you still want to know?

## Needle exchange programs are clearly effective

- Prevent transmission of HIV, HCV and other pathogens among people who inject drugs (PWID)

- Increased rates of spontaneous hepatatis C clearence among PWID participating in needle exchange. [@kaberg2018]

- Needle exchange is one approach to <span class="alert">harm reduction</span>.

- Harm reduction implicitly assumes that these are collective rather than individual <span class="alert">moral</span> problems to solve.

## What explains moral opposition to needle exchange and harm reduction more generally?

![Survey-based research suggested that placing a strong value on moral 'purity' was predictive of reduced support for needle exchange [@christie2019]](../images/20221205090145.png)  

## These attitudes impact people who participate in these programs

## Earlier testing and case-finding could have slowed a large HIV outbreak in Indiana

## Some questions for the class:

- What similarities and differences do you see in the social trajectory of the COVID pandemic vs. the HIV pandemic?

- Was HIV ever treated as a collective problem? If so, for whom?

## Some questions to think about during the next clip ðŸŽ¬

- Do you buy Feldman's arguments about the normalization of COVID?

- Are there parallels in the ways scientific authority was used and abused during the early days of HIV and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic?

- If we don't hide pandemics to get back to some form of normal everyday life, what is the <span class="alert">alternative</span>? 

## Being an effective participant in the conversation, you have to be clear about the interests that shape it (~15m)

## In small groups

- Do you buy Feldman's arguments about the normalization of COVID?

- Are there parallels in the ways scientific authority was used and abused during the early days of HIV and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic?

- If we don't hide pandemics to get back to some form of normal everyday life, what is the <span class="alert">alternative</span>?
