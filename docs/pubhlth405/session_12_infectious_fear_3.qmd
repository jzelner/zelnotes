## What explains the <span class="alert">persistence</span> of residential segregation? {.smaller}

## Agenda

- Finding the Lung Block in Baltimore.

- Territorial stigmatization and other traps üï≥Ô∏è in characterizing <span class="alert">health disparities</span>.

- Getting ready for <span class="alert">project proposals</span>.


## Infectious Fear Discussion Format for Today

Start in small groups, each answering <span class="alert">one</span> discussion question, and report back to big group for discussion:

1. What was the idea of the <span class="alert">lung block</span> and where did it originate? How is this related to house infection theory?

2. What was problematic about using <span class="alert">residential location</span> to map out TB risk in Baltimore?

3. How were social science concepts and racial ideologies mixed to create <span class="alert">housing policies</span>?

4. How did <span class="alert">Black physicians and community leaders</span> push back against the ideas of Janet Kemp and other White 'reformers'?

## Does this critique have contemporary relevance?

> "By representing the end result of illness (death), the spot map was entirely ineffective for <span class="alert">conveying the social processes that created the geographic distribution of health disparities</span>. No apparent causal relation (through, for example, the process of urban underdevelopment) would have been apparent between...the ill terrain of poverty and the fear felt by residents of Baltimore's more affluent neighborhoods." [@roberts2009,p.108-9]

## Selective <span class="alert">attention</span> $\to$ biased <span class="alert">results</span>

- Janet Kemp made detailed measurements of living conditions in white-occupied tenements, but not in primarily-black alley houses.

- Said that recollections of, e.g. number of people living in a house, would be "entirely untrustworthy" and "a waste of time". [@roberts2009, p.127]

- Instead, diagnosed risk in the area as a function of <span class="alert">perceived moral failings</span> of Black residents.

## ...And policies that perpetuate inequality

- Made specific policy recommendations for tenements, regarding building height, fire exits, etc.

- No specific recommendations for alley houses.

- Led to 1908 redefinition of a tenement as any house w/3+ families, and subjected these buildings to regulation.

- By focusing on <span class="alert">families per dwelling</span> rather than people per room, the smaller, older alley houses were left unregulated. [@roberts2009, p.130]

## Coalitions were important for making inroads against alley house conditions

- Black physicians, such as Dr. James Waring, recognized the role of landlords and others in the conditions of alley houses.

:::{.fragment}
> Waring‚Äôs critique was not limited to the individual behavior of alley residents. That ‚Äò‚Äòfew of these alleys, many of which are not over ten feet wide, are fit for habitations‚Äô‚Äô was largely the fault of unscrupulous landlords and the city‚Äôs failure to  regulate them. He thus called into question "the conscience of the American people" who "ignore[d] the fact that little children" were <span class="alert">"compelled to live  [where] sunlight, pure air, pure thoughts, chaste conduct and associates . . .  are denied them from their very birth." </span>[@roberts2009, p.132]
:::

- Also recognized that any chance of reform rested on the ability to make common cause with white male leaders of Baltimore.

# Racial Health Disparities and Covid-19: Caution üöß and Context

## Mapping out the ideas in the piece by Chowkwanyun and Reed

- What are the key critiques that Chowkwanyun & Reed leverage against the ways researchers and the public often try to explain <span class="alert">racial health disparities</span>?

- What alternative methods do they suggest?

- What are the <span class="alert">policy</span> or <span class="alert">practice</span> implications of this piece?

# Thinking about <span class="alert">audiences</span> for your final product

## Balancing the corners of the <span class="alert">rhetorical triangle</span>

![Effective communication reflects balanced attention to each element.](../images/20221010094902.png)  

More info on the [rhetorical triangle idea](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/RhetoricalTriangle.htm)

## Challenge of the final assignment comes from metabolizing information and <span class="alert">purposively</span> communicating it to a new audience.

![Assignment schematic example from [Paul Handstedt](https://twitter.com/curriculargeek/status/1045042716210589696)](../images/20221010095557.png){height=300}  

Starting with defining your <span class="alert">communication goals</span> and <span class="alert">intended audience</span> will help all the other pieces fall into place!

## An <span class="alert">opinion piece</span> using data to advocate for a policy position

## A visit to the original <span class="alert">Lung Block</span>

## Identifying the purpose of your final product üóùÔ∏è 

In pathogen groups:

- What is a <span class="alert">contemporarily relevant</span> lesson you want other people to take away from your research on your pathogen?

- Are there modern-day <span class="alert">misconceptions</span> about your pathogen or a related issue you want to dispel?

- What present-day <span class="alert">policy</span>, <span class="alert">practice</span> or <span class="alert">social</span> changes do you want to impact?

- What <span class="alert">mode of communication</span> do you think will be most effective for this purpose?

  - Identify examples you find useful and compelling and that might serve as <span class="alert">inspiration</span>.


## Next Time

- In Class <span class="alert">*Configuration*</span> workshop!

- Come ready to <span class="alert">work on your paper</span> with your group.

- During class, I will hold 'office hours' with each group for 10-15m. 

- Please <span class="alert">confer with your group ahead of time</span> about what type of final product you are thinking about for your project so that we can discuss it.
