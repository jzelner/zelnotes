# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/cholera_galaxy_brain.jpg">

Mental models, past and <span class="alert">present</span> (or at least recent past...)

## Agenda

- Chronicling the end of the Golden Square outbreak

- Bringing lessons from *The Ghost Map* into the present.

- Starting to construct a comprehensive <span class="alert">mental model</span> of your pathogen.

## What do you think the implications of this (very) short story are for <span class="alert">us</span>?

## The last days of the Broad Street Outbreak

- What evidence began to convince Henry Whitehead of the <span class="alert">contamination</span> theory?

- What were the conclusions of the Vestry Committee on the cause of the outbreak? What may have kept them from adopting Snow's theory?

- What was the likely impact of the removal of the pump handle on the trajectory of the outbreak? 

- What possible <span class="alert">preventive</span> effects did removing the handle have? Why?

## What's old is new...
 

 In this paper, I have argued that both the long delays in replacing flawed, miasma-driven approaches to cholera prevention in the nineteenth century and long delays in replacing an exclusively contact-and-droplet model of SARS-CoV-2 prevention with one that includes airborne transmission in the twenty-first had a philosophical explanation in terms of which <span class="alert">mental models of reality</span> prevailed and the extent to which scientists and policymakers favoured <span class="alert">data over theory</span>. (Greenhalgh 2021)

## Well thought-out <span class="alert">mental models</span> let us:

  <li class = "fragment">Characterize <span class="alert">meaningful</span> relationships between physical environments, social environments, and health.</li>
  <li class = "fragment">Reveal the appropriate <span class="alert">scale</span> of analysis and intervention. </li>
  <li class="fragment">Explore the implications of geographically varying policies.</li>
  </ul>


## Mental models are intuition <span class="alert">pumps</span>

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

As described by the philosopher Daniel Dennett:

  > Intuition pumps are cunningly designed [thought experiments, which] <span class="alert">focus the reader's attention on "the important" features</span>, and...deflect the reader from bogging down in hard-to-follow details. (From Dennett, 1984)

## Why are <span class="alert">mental models</span> so critical to how we understand and intervene in epidemics?

- What is <span class="alert">evidence-based medicine</span>, and what is Greenhalgh's critique of its role in the COVID-19 pandemic?

- How does Peter Medawar characterize the relationships between <span class="alert">theory</span> and <span class="alert">data</span> in science?

- Specifically, what weaknesses does she highlight in the Danamask RCT?

- What alternative sources of evidence does she argue should have been considered sooner?


## Small <span class="alert">scale</span> data provided compelling evidence for the droplet theory of SARS-CoV-2 transmission {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/cdc_choir_practice.jpg">

Does this echo anything from *The Ghost Map*?

## Why didn't <span class="alert">mechanistic</span> evidence dislodge the droplet-only perspective on SARS-CoV-2 transmission? {.imgslide}

## EBM's hierarchy of evidence 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- What is meant by 'risk of bias'?

- Quality of evidence?

- Where would Snow's explorations fit in this hierarchy?
