## Epidemic as a play in three acts:

1. Progressive <span class="alert">Revelation</span>

2. Managing <span class="alert">Randomness</span>

3. Negotiating Public <span class="alert">Response</span>

## Progressive Revelation

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
> Only when the presence of an epidemic becomes unavoidable is there public admission of its existence. <span class="alert">Bodies must accumulate and the sick must suffer in increasing numbers</span> before officials acknowledge what can no longer be ignored. [@rosenberg2020a, p.566]

## Managing Randomness

> Accepting the existence of an epidemic implies — in some sense demands — the creation of a framework within which its dismaying arbitrariness may be managed. <span class="alert">Collective agreement on that explanatory framework</span> may be seen as the inevitable second stage in any epidemic. [@rosenberg2020a, pp.567]



## Public Response

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
>  In the stress of an epidemic..., <span class="alert">failure to take action constitutes action</span>.  An epidemic might in this sense be likened to a trial, with policy choices constituting the possible verdicts. [@rosenberg2020a, pp.569]

# Stigma as a fundamental cause of health inequity

## What is <span class="alert">stigma</span> and why does it drive inequity in health outcomes?

Based on [@hatzenbuehler2013]:

- How would you define the concept of stigma?

- What is the relationship between stigma and other fundamental causes like racism and SES?

- What avenues for prevention or intervention does an understanding of the role of stigma as a fundamental cause open up?

## What is problematic about analyzing or addressing one stigmatized status at a time?

![Table 1 from [@hatzenbuehler2013]](../images/20221101153931.png) 

## How are the health effects of stigma maintained over time?

![What is going on in this figure?](../images/20221101154514.png)

## Stigma serves to create and maintain <span class="alert">power imbalances
</span>

<span class="alert">In pathogen groups:</span> Can you come up with some examples - relevant to your pathogen if possible - in which disease-related stigma serves to:

1.<span class="alert"> Keep people down</span> via social and economic exploitation.

2. <span class="alert">Keep people in</span> via the enforcement of restrictive social norms.

3. <span class="alert">Keep people away</span> as a means of avoiding contact with individuals perceived to be diseased.
