## Agenda

- Digesting Chapters 3 & 4 (35m)

- A little more detail about <span class="alert">residential segregation</span>.

- Preview of next time.

## Snowball ‚òÉÔ∏è discussion about Chs 3 & 4

1. Spend a few minutes <span class="alert">on your own</span>, thinking about and adding a quick response to what struck you most about the readings.

2. <span class="alert">Pair up</span> and discuss the next question.

3. Join pairs into groups of <span class="alert">4</span> for the next discussion.

4. Groups of <span class="alert">6-8</span> for final question.

## ‚è≤Ô∏è On your own

Spend a few minutes going back over the text and put your answers to these questions in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12acwQXd3-FE2MP38Up_TsBDFPwf0RtLEVw143KwIB8c/edit?usp=sharing):

- What is Roberts referring to when he describes the <span class="alert">landscape of health</span> in Chapter 3?

- What were you most confused or surprised about in these chapters? 

- What struck you as most important?

## In <span class="alert">pairs</span> 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

- Focusing on Chapter 3, what does the discussion in this chapter add to our understanding of how segregation and racism act as <span class="alert">fundamental causes</span> of health inequality?

- What other diseases - <span class="alert">infectious and non-communicable</span> - were linked to racial residential segregation and living conditions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries? 

- How does this information support - or not - the role of racism and SES as <span class="alert">fundamental causes</span> in TB disparities?

- What are the <span class="alert">push</span> and <span class="alert">pull</span> factors that Roberts invokes to exlpain the emergence of the Druid Hill Corridor as a Black ghetto characterized by intense segregation and high rates of TB and other infectious diseases?

- In chapter 4, what similarities and differences did you see been <span class="alert">infected house theory</span> and the miasmatic theories discussed in *The Ghost Map*? 

  - What were some surprising implications of infected house theory for public health <span class="alert">surveillance</span> and intervention?

 - Identify the most important built environment, biological and social mechanisms Roberts describes that link <span class="alert">segregation</span> in Baltimore to racial inequities in TB outcomes.

Go back to your initial reflections:

- What do you remain confused or unsure about? 

- What most surprised/struck you in these chapters?

- Drop a comment on any items you think have been resolved through your discussions.

# What is residential segregation?



## How would you define <span class="alert">residential segregation</span>?



:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out fragment-index=1}
> "Racial residential (i.e., housing) segregation is one of the most pervasive patterns in American metropolitan areas and a powerful engine of racial stratification. <span class="alert">Whites and blacks are separated into different residential neighborhoods with markedly different resources to support health and well-being over the life course.</span>" [@acevedo-garcia2008]
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in fragment-index=2}

> At a general level, residential segregation is the degree to which two or more groups live separately from one another, in different parts of the urban environment. <span class="alert">This general understanding masks considerable underlying complexity, however, for groups may live apart from one another and be "segregated" in a variety of ways.</span> [@massey1988]

## What are the <span class="alert">dimensions</span> of residential segregation? {.smaller .scrollable}

Some canonical definitions from [@massey1988]:

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
Evenness
: "Minority members may be distributed so that they are overrepresented in some areas and underrepresented in others, varying on the characteristic of <span class="alert">evenness</span>."

Exposure
: "[Minority group members] may be distributed so that their exposure to majority members is limited by virtue of rarely <span class="alert">sharing a neighborhood</span> with them."


Concentration
: "They may be spatially concentrated <span class="alert">within a very small area</span>, occupying less physical space than majority members."

:::
:::{.column width=50%}
Centralization

: "They may be spatially centralized, <span class="alert">congregating around the urban core</span>, and occupying a more central location than the majority."

Clustering

: "[A]reas of minority settlement may be tightly clustered to form <span class="alert">one large contiguous enclave</span>, or be scattered widely around the urban area."

:::{.fragment}
<span class="alert">Do any of these describe the patterns of segregation described in Infectious Fear?</span>

## Alley houses

> "In the lower-rent alleys between these two avenues could be found poorer blacks, who resided in one- or two-story houses whose front steps in many cases were separated from the opposite house by no more than six or eight feet of cobblestone or dirt."

## A Typology of Segregation

Grigoryeva and Ruef define three types of segregation:

Primary (P)
: Separation of groups across administrative or political boundaries.

Secondary (S)
: Separation of groups in *physical space*

Tertiary (T) 
: Function of residential street layout that influence *pedestrian paths*.

## Pattern was pervasive throughout D.C.

## So: How do we <span class="alert">measure</span> this type of segregation?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
- Classic approach, e.g. [@massey1988], only captures <span class="alert">primary</span> segregation.

- Grigoryeva & Ruef noticed that information could be extracted from the order in which <span class="alert">19th century census takers visited houses</span>. [@grigoryeva2015]

- Data were recorded sequentially in their records as they went üè† to üè†.

- Compared observed sequences of black and white households to a random distribution to measure the extent of <span class="alert">tertiary segregation</span>.

- Called their measure the *Sequential Index of Segregation* (SIS)
