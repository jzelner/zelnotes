## Feedback on pathogen project 

- More in-class project workdays would be helpful.

- Helpful and interesting to see other group presentations and get feedback.

- Uneven attendance, particularly for in-class project work, puts those with consistently missing partners at a disadvantage.

## <span class="alert">Changes</span> in response to feedback üîÅ

- 15% pathogen project participation grade. 

- Based on attendance during in-class workdays and feedback from group members. 

- In-class workdays on 11/14 and 11/28 and 12/7 (partial).

- Lightning (~10m) project update presentations on 11/30

- Sign-in on these days (incl. today)


# Fiasco Episodes 2 & 3

## On your own

In the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHtIa94D2avmCJQkTfzcLYkj-IEQX28dKpA2ncio4AI/edit?usp=sharing):

1. What did you find most interesting or surprising in this episode? 

2. Where do you think we are in Rosenberg's <span class="alert">epidemic trajectory</span> at this point? 

3. How would you interpret the role of stigma in the public health, medical, and community response to the crisis up until now?

4. What specific questions or thoughts do you have about these episodes for our Q&A on Weds?

## Some more questions: 

1. What are some similarities and differences between the multi-factorial theory of AIDS and the miasma theory of Cholera?

2. In hindsight, where do you think you would have come down on the decision to keep the baths open in San Francisco or force them to close? Why?

3. What parallels do you see between the controversy around pieces like *"We Know Who We Are"* and discourses about masking, vaccination and other aspects of personal choice during COVID-19?

## Getting ready for <span class="alert">Weds Q&A</span>

- Go into the [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHtIa94D2avmCJQkTfzcLYkj-IEQX28dKpA2ncio4AI/edit?usp=sharing) we have been using to keep track of thoughts/questions about Fiasco Eps 1-3.

- Upvote questions or other items that you would like to bring up during our discussion.

- Are there any questions specifically relevant to your project?

- We will briefly review questions after and I will collate and share w/Madeline & Ula.
