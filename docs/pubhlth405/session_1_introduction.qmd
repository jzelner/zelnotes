## What will we do this term?

- Examine how social and biological systems influence each other to produce spatio-temporal patternns of infection.

- Go deep on the mechanisms that create historical and present-day inequalities in infection. 

- Think about how these understandings should influence how we intervene in socio-biological systems of infection.

- Our overarching goal is to draw lessons from the <span class="alert">epidemiological past</span> that can help us in the present and future.

- Develop and explore your own questions about the social and biological mechanisms driving infectious disease transmission.

## Jumping in with both feet ü§ø

What do you think the most important ways are that social systems impact (5m on your own):

1. Infectious disease <span class="alert">transmission</span> and,

2. Infectious disease <span class="alert"> outcomes</span> (i.e. severe disease, disability, and death)?

## With your neighbors üèòÔ∏è

Spend another <span class="alert">5-10m</span> discussing these questions:

1. What do you think a social history *is*, <span class="alert">anyway</span>?

2. Why might it be important to take a <span class="alert">social historical</span> perspective on infectious disease? 

## What is a social history?

According to our friends at Wikipedia, social history is:

> "An area of history that focuses on the "lived experience of the past".

## The three main tasks of social history:

1. Documenting large <span class="alert">structural</span> changes; 
2. Reconstructing the experiences of <span class="alert">ordinary people</span> in the course of those changes; and 
3. <span class="alert">Connecting</span> the two

## <span class="alert">How</span>, exactly, are we going to do that?


Half of the class take 10m to review and diagram out the themes of the course:


- [Syllabus](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/PUBHLTH405/PUBHLTH+405+Syllabus)

- [Key Texts](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/PUBHLTH405/Key+Books+%26+Other+Resources)

Other half, do the same but for the semester-long project:

- [Semester project](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/PUBHLTH405/pathogen+project/Pathogen+Project)
