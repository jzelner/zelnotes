## Agenda

- Pathogen project groups and assignment updates (5m)

- Overview of the CDC's different types of outbreaks/epidemics. (10m)

- Configuration, contamination, and predisposition. (10m)

- How can and should we use infection history as a guide for <span class="alert">pandemic preparedness</span>? (15m)

- Break (5m)

- Integrating ideas of <span class="alert">configuration</span> and <span class="alert">contamination</span> into CDC definitions and guidelines. (~30m)

- Preview of next time (5m)

## Pathogen Project Groups

Final slate of pathogens:

1. Bacterial STIs
2. Malaria
3. Monkeypox
4. MRSA
5. Pediatric diarrheal illness
6. Plague
7. Polio

You can find group assignments [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WUp4amfEap5lil9DpcZd38JGdH5vj3fcFdRoBic0HOw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Contamination assignment

- Contamination assignment now due <span class="alert">before class</span> on 9/26

- On that day I will ask you to get into pathogen groups for the first time and start comparing notes from your <span class="alert">contamination</span> research.

# Characterizing Epidemic Causes

## Common Source Epidemics

What are the different modes of common-source outbreaks and epidemics?

# Explaining Epidemics

## Rosenberg's parts of an epidemic <span class="alert">explanation</span>

In broad strokes, what do the mechanisms that Rosenberg identifies in 'Explaining Epidemics' cover?

- Contamination 🦠

- Configuration 🧩

- Predisposition ❓

## Why is it important to understand the explanations that are - and have historically - been used?

:::{.fragment}
> <span class="alert">Perception implies explanation.</span> Certainly this is the case in epidemics when  fear and anxiety create an imperative need for understanding and thus reassurance. [@rosenberg1992b, p. 293]
:::

:::{.fragment}
> This is not to suggest a democracy among hypothetical etiologies; some explanations approximate the natural world a great deal better than others (and thus provide different real-world choices). But the continuity that I seek to emphasize relates to function, not specific content; and that function is the <span class="alert">unavoidable act of explanation itself</span>. [@rosenberg1992b, p. 294]

## How would <span class="alert">you</span> summarize the critique that is made in the Mamelund piece? 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- What common fallacy about <span class="alert">pandemics</span> do Mamelund and Dimka identify?

- What <span class="alert">motivations</span> do they identify for deeper study of the 1918 influenza pandemic in the context of COVID?

- How might Rosenberg describe the way we ended up here?

- Thinking back to the [Krishnan piece](https://www.dropbox.com/s/leby8v8cnq66f9b/krishnan_et_al_2020_historical_insights_on_coronavirus_disease_2019_%28covid-19%29%2C_the_1918_influenza.pdf?dl=0) from the beginning of the term, do they come up with a similar or different conclusion?

## The myth of the <span class="alert">equal opportunity infector</span> comes from of an overemphasis on contamination over configuration

<div class="r-stack">
  <img class="fragment" src="../images/equal_opportunity_virus.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="../images/equal_opportunity_herald.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="../images/equal_opportunity_rural.png">
  <img class="fragment" src="../images/equal_opportunity_delta.png">
  </div>


## How could a pathogen <span class="alert">actually</span> be an equal opportunity infector?

- <span class="alert">Susceptibility</span> is uniformly distributed across the population.
- Host and pathogen biology are the primary important factors in determining <span class="alert">infectiousness.</span>
- Protective <span class="alert">health behaviors</span> are equally available to everyone.

- Social and spatial differences in <span class="alert">exposure</span> by race and wealth are dwarfed by these biological factors.
</span>

:::{.fragment}
If this is so clearly false, why do we often fall into this kind of trap?

## Continuing to <span class="alert">revise</span> CDC's definitions  

- Get back into your groups from last Weds. 

- If you weren't here, link up with an existing group.

- Open up [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KDZubj5-MlLY6K6vLBlRHn1DkMkGg8C8DzerdEIG21Q/edit?usp=sharing) and read the instructions for Part II to get started.

- If you have time, go back and clean up edits etc. from last session.
