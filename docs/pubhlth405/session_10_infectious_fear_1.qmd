## Agenda

- Logistics

- Some basics of TB epidemiology

- Collectively making sense of Chs 1 & 2 of *Infectious Fear*

:::{.notes}

*Goals*


:::

## Logistics

- Configuration assignment currently due 10/12

- Two scheduled in-class work days before group presentations (10/19, 10/24)

- <span class="alert">A proposal:</span>
  
  - Make configuration assignment a <span class="alert">group assignment</span> due M 10/19

  - Move one in-class work day up to 10/12 

  - During each of these work sessions I will have ~10-15m 'office hrs' with each group to answer questions and help troubleshoot both the configuration assignment and presentations.

## Models, Mental

## Respiratory infection with transmission facilitated by <span class="alert">close contact</span>

## Repeat exposure plays an important role in TB <span class="alert">epidemiology</span>

- <span class="alert">Primary Infection:</span> On first infection, individuals are more likely to have rapid onset of severe disease and are at higher immediate risk of death.

- <span class="alert">Secondary Infection:</span> On subsequent exposures, individuals are less likely to develop disease quickly and those that do may have longer-term, chronic infections. 

- Why is this distinction important in the first two chapters of <span class="alert">Infectious Fear</span>?

## TB can become <span class="alert">latent</span> or dormant in the body and re-emerge

## In the U.S., TB declined dramatically over the course of the 20th century

## <span class="alert">But:</span> It is likely that COVID-19 has slowed or <span class="alert">reversed</span> the decline of TB in the U.S.

# Infectious Fear

## ‚è≤Ô∏è 5m response

Open up this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12acwQXd3-FE2MP38Up_TsBDFPwf0RtLEVw143KwIB8c/edit?usp=sharing) and write down:

- What were you confused üòµ‚Äçüí´ by and would like to discuss/clarify?

- What was your most important takeaway from these initial chapters?

- What surprised üò≤ you most?

## Why is the book called <span class="alert">Infectious Fear</span>?

:::{.fragment}
> This book is primarily concerned with two overlapping and mutually informative periods in U.S. urban history: the <span class="alert">era of infectious fear all but vanquished by the discovery of antimicrobial therapies</span>, and a period, before the Second World War, when health policy and social policy were, comparatively speaking, overwhelmingly dominated by politics derived from <span class="alert">local rather than federal mandates</span>. [@roberts2009, p.20]
:::

## How has this statement aged into the COVID era?

> No naive nostalgia for the germ is presumed in imagining, for example, that many of the health problems of post-war inner cities, many of which are not infectious but are nonetheless tied to geography, might have appeared more urgent‚Äîas public health problems as opposed to simply social or moral problems‚Äîhad there still existed a disease that <span class="alert">plainly...illustrated the geographical links among class, geography, and health</span>. [@roberts2009, p.40]

## Making Sense of Chapters 1 & 2

- Open up this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPRxj_pQ=/?share_link_id=765671544644) (pw: `phthisis`)

- In groups, work on filling in the picture I have started for each chapter.

- Groups will get a chance to report out to the class and explain their different interpretations.
