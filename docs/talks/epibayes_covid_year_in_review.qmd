## Big themes

- Infection inequity

- Mitigating observation biases to make better use of adminsitrative/observational datasets

- Scaling from cohorts to populations


## Specific Projects

- Understanding the <span class="alert">mechanistic drivers</span> of COVID-19 mortality inequity

- Mitigating the impacts of observation bias on estimates of <span class="alert">disparity/inequity</span>.

- Accurately measuring vaccine efficacy against <span class="alert">post-infection outcomes</span>.

- Assessing key axes of spatiotemporal variation in excess mortality in Michigan during the COVID-19 era.


## Infection timing was a key driver of race/ethnic differences in 2020 COVID-19 mortality in Michigan

## Large <span class="alert">between-group</span> differences in incidence rates over time

## <span class="alert">Minimal</span> between-group variation in case-fatality within each time period

## If the <span class="alert">tempo</span> of infection had been equal across groups, large fractions of the disparity in COVID-19 mortality could have been avoided

## Non-random missingness is a huge barrier to accurate estimation of disparities

## Making better sense of how to intervene in these inequities requires us to expand <span class="alert">how</span> we model

## Bringing in more detailed covariate data to make better estimates of vaccine efficacy

# What's next?

## Uncovering the social determinants of spatially clustered excess mortality

## Detailed all-cause and SARS-CoV-2 specific mortality data let us look at infection dynamics at a fine scale

## Excess deaths in Michigan quickly became spatially synchronized in 2020

## Continued efforts at public and stakeholder engagement

- Presentations to Michigan Dept. of Health and Human Services throughout 2021-22

- Presentation to the Lt. Governor's COVID-19 Task Force on Racial Disparities in Summer 2022

- Continued (though reduced ðŸ¥µ) media interviews

- Development of interactive tools for teaching and public engagement

## Using simulation to break regression models

## Understanding <span class="alert">mechanistic relationships</span> between segregation and infection inequity

## Moving on, Moving up

- Joey Dickens began a position at Google in Fall 2022

- Ramya Naraharisetti will begin as an EIS officer with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services in Summer 2023

- Rob Trangucci is currently on the faculty job market

- Emily Andrus will be joining our group in January 2023
