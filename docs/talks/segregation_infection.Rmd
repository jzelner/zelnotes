# Early pandemic models focused on <span class="alert">established</span> priorities

>- Age-specific incidence and mortality.
>- Hospital and ICU capacity.
>- Short- and long-term forecasting of incidence and mortality.
>- Impacts of lockdowns on infection risk.

<span class="alert">Inequality</span> was not one of the key early foci.
