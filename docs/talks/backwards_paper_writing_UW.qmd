## Agenda

- Who are we and why do we care about this?

- What does it mean to write backwards?

- Is this anything more than a set of tricks ü™Ñ?

## Who am I?

- Social epidemiologist/infectious disease researcher at UM School of Public Health.

- Partially lapsed sociologist.

- Excitable person with a fairly short attention span.

- <span class="alert">And: </span> Mostly recovered not-finisher of papers.

## Why did we write this paper?

- Realized that students often have similar questions about how to structure and write papers. 

- I often forget many of these ideas  and it's nice to have a reference.

- Successful scientific writing emerges from a <span class="alert">hidden curriculum</span> that is not uniformly available to up-and-coming researchers. 

- Having a checklist ‚òëÔ∏è is helpful in a lot of other contexts where <span class="alert">detail</span> is important, so why not manuscript writing?

## Pandemic-era online teaching forced me to learn the concept of <span class="alert">backwards design</span>

![Even though I look extremely tired in this video from 2020, [I learned a lot](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/01/06/what-i-learned-from-teaching-online/)](../images/jz_online_image.png)

## What does <span class="alert">forward design</span> look like in teaching?

- Make a list of topics you think are important.

- Write/deliver a lecture on each one.

- Come up with some assignments that may or may not track with the things you are talking about/doing in class.

- Plow through until the end of the semester.

- Sleep, recover, repeat.

## Backwards design means starting with your <span class="alert">goals</span>

> Our lessons, units, and courses should be logically inferred from the [learning outcomes] sought, not derived from the methods, books, and activities with which we are most comfortable. Curriculum should lay out the most effective ways of achieving specific results...<span class="alert">the best designs derive backward from the learnings sought</span>. [@wiggins2005]

## Forward writing <span class="alert">=</span> Writing the way you read
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
- Start with the intro 

- Methods, Results, Discussion

- End with the conclusion

- Circulate, revise, repeat

- What about this can <span class="alert">go wrong</span>?

- Why do we so often write this way?

## Backwards paper writing is just a  <span class="alert">goal-oriented</span> approach to research and writing

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width=60%}

1. Set <span class="alert">high-level</span> scientific and professional goals for your work. 

2. Think carefully about who you <span class="alert">audience</span> is and how that will impact your choices.

3. Attack manuscript sections separately with a clear idea of the <span class="alert">purpose</span> of each.

4. Get feedback, revise, publish/publicize.

# What are <span class="alert">your goals</span> when writing?

## Some <span class="alert">real-world goals</span> of academic writing

- <span style="font-size:3em">Getting a job</span>
- <span style="font-size:2em">Keeping your job</span>
- <span style="font-size:1.25em">Increasing your h-index</span>
- <span style="font-size:0.75em">Communication</span>
- <span style="font-size:0.5em">Self-teaching</span>

## If <span class="alert">clear communication</span> is the top item, the others are more likely to fall into place

- Your writing shows how great your work is.
- It can go faster because you approach each piece with a plan and a sense of purpose.
- Forcing yourself to be clear often means <span class="alert">clarifying</span> things to yourself.
- People will want to read and cite papers they can actually understand.
- Less likely to burn out üî• on the whole process

## <span class="alert">Rigidity</span> of paper format can be your friend

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width=60%}

- Each section has a <span class="alert">purpose</span>

- Aligning the purpose of each section with your <span class="alert">goals</span> is the challenge. 

- All we do is provide [some questions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921003068) to help you to put these together

- More structure $\to$ More agency?

## What is the <span class="alert">purpose</span> of each manuscript?

Introduction
: What is the problem your analysis is meant to address or solve?

Methods/Data
: Explain what you've done with maximal clarity.

Results
: Just the results, with the minimum amount of discussion 'glue' to hold it together.

Discussion
: A mini-paper within the paper where you summarize, sell the product, and talk about the future.


## Increasing complexity of analysis pipelines has made clarity even more important
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=60%}
- Large, complex datasets require lots of <span class="alert">choices</span> to be made. 

- To be <span class="alert">reproducible</span> paper needs to be clear and code well-documented.

- Thought-out, well-designed papers are easier to update and revise.

- Reducing <span class="alert">friction</span> in the revision process makes you less likely to fall into scientific and ethical sinkholes üï≥Ô∏è.

## A <span class="alert">beginning</span> rather than an end

- These ideas reflect the particular challenges and constraints of writing for epidemiology.

- Each writer will have their own toolkit, but we hope this provides either a foundation or inspiration to build your own.

- Thanks!
