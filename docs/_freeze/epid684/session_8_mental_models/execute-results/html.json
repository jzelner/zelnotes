(Koch 2021)\n\n# But: A geographic perspective does not automatically foster <span class=\"alert\">equity</span>\n\n> Granularity of data allows more finegrained analyses, including multilevel spatial modeling. But presented by themselves, such granular data can reinforce what the sociologist Loïc Wacquant has dubbed “territorial stigmatization,” whereby <span class=\"alert\"> resource-deprived neighborhoods suffer from “blemish of place”</span> and are thought to be “composed essentially of poor people, minorities and foreigners,” many of whom have already been marginalized by the broader society. (Chowkwanyun & Reed, 2020)\n\n# Data accessibility $\\ne$ Data equality \n\n> While democratizing the result is not universally democratic. An ability to access the data depends on internet access which is not yet universal. Even with that access, manipulation of the data requires cartographic and statistical programs that, while increasingly available at low cost, are neither free nor intuitive. <span class=\"alert\">Nor is there any guarantee that alternate interpretations and critical studies will be broadly disseminated.</span> (Koch 2021)\n\n# Building our own theory with <span class=\"alert\">mind maps</span> {.imgslide}\n\n<img src=\"../images/fairy_mind_map.png\">\n\nAnother way of [thinking through the implications of what we've read](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/R3RITk15MWRya0UyQnB2YzVJUVh6MVIycXBJSnIydnRCRGVBQk05OUpIS2JOOTd0ZkJtYWJhcHZodnZMc2d0NHwzMDc0NDU3MzUwNDM2MzA5MTQx?invite_link_id=434523903486).\n\n# Questions\n\n[Question 1](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORxu2mw=/?moveToWidget=3458764517655932395&cot=14)\n\n[Question 2](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORxu2mw=/?moveToWidget=3458764517656172651&cot=14)\n\n[Question 3](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORxu2mw=/?moveToWidget=3458764517656431188&cot=14)\n\n\n# Return to <span style=\"color: gold\">Golden Square</span> {.imgslide}\n\n<a href = \"https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/john-snow-cholera\">\n  <img src=\"../images/snow_cholera_map.jpg\">\n</a>\n\nSaying goodbye by spending some quality time with the [outbreak data](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/john-snow-cholera)\n\n\n# Next Time\n\n- What is <span class=\"alert\">clustering</span> and why should you care?\n- Smoothing in two dimensions.",
