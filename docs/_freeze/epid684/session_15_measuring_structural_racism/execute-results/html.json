Captures the same basic idea but is a bit more intutive.\n\n>- Uses information on a location and its surrounding areas to estimate local intensity.\n\n# Getis-Ord $G_i$ statistic\n\n$$G_{i}(d)=\\frac{\\sum_{j}w_{ij}(d)x_j}{\\sum_{j}x_j}$$\n\nWhere:\n\n>- $d$ is the maximum <span class=\"alert\">distance</span> to consider clustering \n\n>- $w_{ij}(d)=1$ if place $i$ and place $j$ are within $d$ of each other, and 0 otherwise. (When $i=j$, $w_{ij}=0$)\n\n>- $x_j$ is the variable of interest\n\n>- Yields an estimate of both <span class=\"alert\">strength of clustering</span> and approximate statistical significance.\n\n# Lets us go from this...\n\n![Tornado incidence from Frazier 2019](../images/tornado_incidence.png)\n\n# To this...\n\n![Tornado hot and cold spots identified in Frazier 2019](../images/tornado_getis_ord.png)\n\n# Long-term cohort design in Kershaw et al. allows study of <span class=\"alert\">within-person</span> changes in exposure to segregation.\n\n>- Allows adjustment for individual-level factors such as age, sex, physical activity, smoking, etc. \n\n>- Can measure <span class=\"alert\">changes</span> in segregation intensity in neighborhood of origin and destination for people who have moved.\n\n>- Have to be sure that people who moved are <span class=\"alert\">not systematically different</span> from those who didn't.\n\n# Higher intensity of segregation <span class=\"alert\">$\\to$</span> higher blood pressure.\n \n>- People who moved from a high- to lower-segregation context experienced small but meaningful decreases in blood pressure. \n\n>- Suggests that policies facilitating neighborhood mobility could have positive health effects.\n\n>- Reliance on SBP as a <span class=\"alert\">proxy</span> for CVD is a limitation, but a common one when the outcome is relatively rare and the effect is subtle - even if it is important.\n\n# Doing better work on structural racism requires <span class=\"alert\">creativity</span> \n\n> We must think beyond our training, statistical tests, and practices that dismiss methodologies that we may be unfamiliar with. There is scholarship being overlooked that proposes new approaches we could explore..., <span class=\"alert\">but we cannot move forward with capturing variables like structural racism if we do not explore our creativity</span>. (From Adkins-Jackson 2021)\n\n# Time to <span class=\"alert\">grapple</span> with the complexity of social-spatial relationships in our own work\n\n>- The spatial expression of social inequality is complex.\n\n>- Our measures are necessarily <span class=\"alert\">reductive</span>, and that's OK...\n\n>- <span class=\"alert\">IF and only IF</span> (âŸº) we use these measures carefully without losing sight of the mechanisms and outcomes we care about.\n\n>- Lets spend some time making sense of these ideas using [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOHe4agI=/?invite_link_id=546695231041).\n\n# Next Time\n\n[Relating the mechanisms of structural racism to infectious disease transmission.](https://publish.obsidian.md/epibayes/Courses/EPID684/modules/Module+3/Sessions/6.+Mechanistic+linkages+between+structural+racism+and+infectious+disease+transmission)\n",
