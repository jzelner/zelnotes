- What is an epidemic?

  - According to the CDC?
  - According to Rosenberg?
  - According to <span class="alert">us</span>?

## The different types of <span class="alert">infectious disease events</span> according to the CDC

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width=30%}

:::{.nonincremental}
- Outbreak

- Epidemic

- Endemic

- Pandemic
:::

:::
:::{.column width=70%}
- Take 5m in small groups to discuss what differentiates these from each other. 

- What types of social and historical factors  are likely to influence each of these types of events

- How are they similar? 

- How might they differ?

## Epidemic as a play in three acts:

1. Progressive <span class="alert">Revelation</span>

2. Managing <span class="alert">Randomness</span>

3. Negotiating Public <span class="alert">Response</span>

## Progressive Revelation

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
> Only when the presence of an epidemic becomes unavoidable is there public admission of its existence. <span class="alert">Bodies must accumulate and the sick must suffer in increasing numbers</span> before officials acknowledge what can no longer be ignored. [@rosenberg2020a, p.566]

## Managing Randomness

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
> Accepting the existence of an epidemic implies â€” in some sense demands â€” the creation of a framework within which its dismaying arbitrariness may be managed. <span class="alert">Collective agreement on that explanatory framework</span> may be seen as the inevitable second stage in any epidemic.

## Public Response

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
>  In the stress of an epidemic..., <span class="alert">failure to take action constitutes action</span>.  An epidemic might in this sense be likened to a trial, with policy choices constituting the possible verdicts. [@rosenberg2020a, pp.569]

## How can we <span class="alert">apply</span> Rosenberg's take to real-world problems?

- To what extent do Rosenberg's criteria and those of the CDC align with each other?

- Which set of definitions is more useful from a day-to-day perspective? 

- Could we integrate Rosenberg's ideas into a revised set of guidelines?

## <span class="alert">Revising</span> CDC's definitions  

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- We are going to take a shot at doing a bit of what this <span class="alert">tweet suggests</span>:

- Try to channel some of the ideas from "What is an epidemic?" to <span class="alert">revise</span> widely-used CDC definitions and guidance.
