## Agenda

- A brief introduction to Cholera. (10m)

- Digesting the first chapters of *The Ghost Map*. (30m)

- First pathogen group meetings. (30m)

- Wrapping up (5m)

# <span style="color:white">A brief introduction to *V. Cholerae*</span> {data-background-image="../images/v_cholerae.jpg"}

## Cholera is transmitted via the fecal-oral pathway {.imgslide}

## Cholera transmission happens as part of a complex social-ecological web {.imgslide}

What makes this so <span class="alert">deadly</span>?

## Cholera remains an important cause of global morbidity and mortality {.imgslide}

Approximately 2.5M annual cases, 95K deaths

## In the present day, Cholera often appears in the aftermath of <span class="alert">disasters</span>

## We are currently living through the <span class="alert">seventh</span> global cholera pandemic {.imgslide}

## Johnson summarizes our goals in this class perfectly

> The history of knowledge conventionally focuses on breakthrough ideas and conceptual leaps. <span class="alert">But the blind spots on the map, the dark continents of error and prejudice, carry their own mystery as well.</span> How could so many intelligent people be so grievously wrong for such an extended period of time? How could they ignore so much overwhelming evidence that contradicted their most basic theories? These questions, too, deserve their  own discipline ‚Äî <span class="alert">the sociology of error</span>. [@johnson2007, p. 15]


## A quote I love from *The Ghost Map* {.quote}

<blockquote>
"Most world-historic events - great military battles, political revolutions - are self-consciously historic to the
participants living through them. They act knowing that their decisions will be chronicled and dissected for decades or
centuries to come. But <span class="alert">epidemics create a kind of history from below</span>: they can be world-changing, but the participants are almost inevitably ordinary folk, following their established routines, not thinking for a second about how their actions will be recorded for posterity." (From *The Ghost Map*, p. 32)
</blockquote>

## Stepping into Golden Square

- What <span class="alert">social</span> and <span class="alert">environmental</span> factors made 1850s London an ideal environment for Cholera transmission?

- What <span class="alert">global</span> üåç changes impacted London's Cholera risk in the 19th century?

- How did urbanization impact the evolution of *V. Cholerae*?

- What struck you most in these first couple of chapters?

## Human waste was an unavoidable fact of life in Victorian London

> Victorian London had its postcard wonders, to be sure‚Äîthe Crystal  Palace, Trafalgar Square, the new additions to Westminster Palace. But it also had wonders of a different order, no less remarkable: artificial ponds of raw sewage, dung heaps the size of houses. [@johnson2007, p.11]

> Water closets were a tremendous breakthrough as far as quality of life was concerned, but they had a disastrous effect on the city‚Äôs sewage problem. Without a functioning sewer system to connect to, most WCs simply flushed their contents into existing cesspools, <span class="alert">greatly increasing their tendency to overflow</span>. [@johnson2007, p.12]

> No one died of stench in Victorian London. But tens of thousands died because the fear of stench blinded them to the true perils of the city, and <span class="alert">drove them to implement a series of wrongheaded reforms that only made the crisis worse</span>. [@johnson2007, p.12]

## Pathogen Group Meetings

- Find your other group members!

- Briefly discuss your interest in your topic and what you're hoping to get out of your project.

- Work on developing a shared knowledge-base/annotated bibliography for your *contamination* assignment.

- This can build on the brief ones you put together during our [second class meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beT3ZKjLMhVjjDDYNbojSuVbqdvGQRiXbUI_03EFRgg/edit) if you'd like.
