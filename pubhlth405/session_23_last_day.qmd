## Johnson summarized our goals in this class perfectly in *The Ghost Map* üëª

> The history of knowledge conventionally focuses on breakthrough ideas and conceptual leaps. <span class="alert">But the blind spots on the map, the dark continents of error and prejudice, carry their own mystery as well.</span> How could so many intelligent people be so grievously wrong for such an extended period of time? How could they ignore so much overwhelming evidence that contradicted their most basic theories? These questions, too, deserve their  own discipline ‚Äî <span class="alert">the sociology of error</span>. [@johnson2007, p. 15]


## Everyone is susceptible to explanations that piggyback on our <span class="alert">biases</span> and <span class="alert">emotions</span>

> No one died of stench in Victorian London. But tens of thousands died because the fear of stench blinded them to the true perils of the city, and <span class="alert">drove them to implement a series of wrongheaded reforms that only made the crisis worse</span>. [@johnson2007, p.12]

## <span class="alert">Theoretical perspectives</span> like Rosenberg's are essential for making sense of and comparing epidemics

:::{.fragment}
> <span class="alert">Perception implies explanation.</span> Certainly this is the case in epidemics when  fear and anxiety create an imperative need for understanding and thus reassurance. [@rosenberg1992b, p. 293]

:::{.fragment}
> This is not to suggest a democracy among hypothetical etiologies; some explanations approximate the natural world a great deal better than others (and thus provide different real-world choices). But the continuity that I seek to emphasize relates to function, not specific content; and that function is the <span class="alert">unavoidable act of explanation itself</span>. [@rosenberg1992b, p. 294]

## We have to understand infection inequity in terms of <span class="alert">conflict</span> and competing <span class="alert"> material interests</span> between social and economic groups

## Our <span class="alert">interpretation</span> of data is motivated and shaped by these biases

## Making progress in difficult times requires clarity about what's actually going on

## At the beginning of the term, we asked: <span class="alert">Why should we care about public health history?</span>

## If our whirlwind üå™Ô∏è historical tour has been successful, we have all been left with lessons that are useful for the present and future

> ‚ÄúWe can choose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas...<span class="alert">Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.</span>‚Äù [@roy2020]
