## Agenda

- Review and discuss pieces by Fairchild et al. and Krishnan et al.

- Deeper dive on pathogen project topics.

- Review plans for next meeting (after Labor Day)

## How do we make sense of the role of public health history in the present day?

- What did Hibbert Hill say the old vs. new public health was about in <span class="alert">1913</span>? 

- How well has this idea aged?

- What do you think the <span class="alert">EXODUS</span> in the title refers to?

- What do you think the authors most value about a historical perspective for making sense of <span class="alert">modern public health challenges</span>? 

- How old does an event need to be to qualify as an object of <span class="alert">social historical</span> interest?

# Getting Acquainted with Project Pathogens ü¶†

## Getting to know ü¶†

- I am going to break you into 10 groups each with an assigned pathogen from the [list](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/PUBHLTH405/pathogen+project/Pathogen+Project+Topics)

- Spend some time reading up on your group's pathogen 

- Enter info on the pathogen into this [Google doc](https://goo.gl/maps/zthUMkCy2wDYCvAt8)

- Organize your findings into subheadings of Biology, History, and Present/Future
 
- Can be very basic, feel free to paste in images and links to relevant resources.


## Next Time

[Outbreak, Epidemic, Pandemic](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/PUBHLTH405/modules/Laying+the+Foundation/3.+Outbreak%2C+Epidemic%2C+Pandemic)
