## ACT UP defined a more confrontational and <span class="alert">dramaturgical</span> approach

## Tim Bailey's Political Funeral (1993){.smaller}

:::{.column width=50%}

> ACT UP showed that political silence and inaction were <span class="alert">hostile, not neutral acts</span>. The group collectively made the ill and dying's struggle to reverse the conditions that made AIDS a social and political crisis, visible and audible. 

:::{.fragment}
> The Marys extended this work of support for the ill and dying, taking on the condition of death, <span class="alert">which had previously conceptualized as activism's limit</span>. They made the dead PWA body matter, and through the formation of political affinity, infused the corpse with the <span class="alert">power to speak</span>.

## In small groups

- How did the HIV activism of the late 1980s/early 1990s confront socioeconomic and racial inequity? What were the gaps?

- How did listening to these episodes change how you think about clinical trials - from both a scientific and social perspective? 

- Are there echoes of John Snow's explorations in the drug development process? Why or why not?

- What lessons from ACT UP and other HIV/AIDS activists do you think translate well to the present day? Which might not and why?

#  We have the tools üß∞


## "We have <span class="alert">all</span> the tools..."

## Reflects a <span class="alert">technocratic</span> approach to managing a pandemic.

![Time Magazine, Dec 2021](../images/20221121091155.png)  

## Wait, we <span class="alert">don't</span> have all the tools?

![STAT News, Nov 2022](../images/20221121091245.png)  

## Some questions...

- What lessons from the history of the HIV crisis should make us skeptical of the "we have the tools" approach to COVID-19 that Gonsalves critiques?

- What are <span class="alert">the tools</span> anyway?

- What would a more fundamental-cause inflected approach to the pandemic suggest are the most important compoentns of the toolkit?

## What might explain the incoherent, individualized approach to COVID-19 we are now experiencing?
