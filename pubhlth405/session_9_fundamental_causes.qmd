## Agenda

- What do we mean when we talk about <span class="alert">health equity</span>? 

- What is a <span class="alert">fundamental cause</span> and how is it different from a plain-old cause?

- How might these relate to the problem of <span class="alert">infectious disease transmission</span>?

:::{.notes}

*Goals*

- Get everyone on the same page about health equity/inequity

- Introduce FCT as an important mental model in social epidemiology

- Get students thinking about connections between FCT and their projects

:::

## What are we talking about when we talk about health inequity?

- Open up this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuN_MhT-Jh2uVQj_raZcUnKJKfwAgLkzhRWARtGLEkk/edit?usp=sharing).

- Going to spend ~5m on each question in groups

- After 5m, we will rotate and you can discuss what the previous groups have written down and add to/comment on what is there.

- After everyone has done all of them, we'll come back

:::{.notes}

*Activity*

- Divide students into 4 groups and give them ~5m to discuss each topic.

- Rotate through and then come back and share.

## What is the <span class="alert">fundamental cause</span> approach?

- Mental model about the generation of health inequalities as a function of high-level risks like <span class="alert">socioeconomic status</span> (SES) as well as racial discrimination, social stigma, and residential segregation.

- Focuses on how upstream determinants put individuals <span class="alert">at risk of risks</span>.

- Important for understanding how health inequity <span class="alert">clusters</span> in populations and geographic locations.

## What makes <span class="alert">SES</span> a fundamental cause of health inequity?

- Reflects differential access to <span style="color: green;">money</span>, information and social <span class="alert">power</span>.

- Impacts <span class="alert">multiple</span> more-proximal risks for disease.

- Likely to drive risk across <span class="alert">multiple</span> health outcomes.

- Association <span class="alert">persists</span> even when a <span class="alert">proximal mechanisms</span> are addressed.


## FCT explains how innovation acts as an engine ðŸ›« of health inequality

- When new tools are available for prevention and treatment, they are first available to the most-privileged.

- This *introduces* or *increases* inequity in outcomes at first.

- Over time, the tool becomes available to more people and inequity decreases.

- Over time, the innovation saturates the population and inequality stabilizes or disappears.

## This leads to a relatively predictable <span class="alert">life-cycle</span> of inequity

![Example of how inequity rises and falls as an innovation diffuses through the population from [@zapata-moya2019]](../images/20220927140730.png)  


## We can see the <span class="alert">generation of inequality</span> during the first phases of covid

What interventions or policies might explain this pattern?

## Why is racism a fundamental cause <span class="alert">in addition</span> to SES? 

:::{.fragment}

Why can't <span class="alert">socioeconomic status</span> explain all of this association?
:::


## Racism has many impacts on health that <span class="alert">go beyond and modify</span> SES

- Differential <span class="alert">quality</span> of medical treatment.

- Differential access to health-promoting <span class="alert">environments</span>.

- Employment and housing <span class="alert">discrimination</span>. 

- Emotional and physical <span class="alert">stress</span> resulting from prolonged exposure to discrimination.

## Racial residential <span class="alert">segregation</span> reflects <span class="alert">spatial clustering of risk</span> caused by racism.

## Starting to zoom out for your <span class="alert">configuration</span> project

- Discuss the big conclusions of your 'configuration' papers.

- Feel free to share/combine outputs.

- Identify axes of inequality in disease outcomes for your pathogen(s).

- Do you think inequality is a critical component of the configuration story for your pathogen? Why or why not?

- Describe potential <span class="alert">proximal</span> drivers of inequity.

## Next Time

![What explains the magnitude and persistence of these disparities?](../images/20220927143348.png)  

:::{.notes}

- Read Chs. 1 & 2 of Infectious fear

- First chapter lays out the big picture of TB disparities by race in the early-mid 20th century.

- Second chapter gets into more of the race science that was used to explain TB disparities and suggest that African-Americans were somehow more biologically and morally vulnerable to disease.
