    "text": "In this session, we will focus in on the problem of how we can use epidemiological data to examine the role of Tobler’s first law - the universality of spatial relatedness - as well as Goodchild’s revised first law - the ubiquity of spatial variation - in epidemiology data.\n\n\nPlease read the following two selections. The first is a short article introducing the concept of a disease ‘hotspot’ and the second is a more in-depth treatment of the idea of disease clustering:\n\nRead the piece “What is a Hotspot, Anyway?” by Lessler et al. (2017)\nAnd Chapter 3: Interpreting Clusters of Disease Events from (Lawson et al. 2016)\n\n\n\n\nDuring the first half of class, we will discuss the readings and key concepts in them and I will introduce the concept of kernel smoothing and its application to epidemiologic data as a tool for visualizing and identifying disease clusters.\nIn the second half of class, we will complete a hands-on activity in which we will experiment with smoothing different types of simulated data using this interactive tutorial."

    "text": "Welcome to EPID 684\n\nIn this course, we will take an exploratory and collaborative approach to defining and understanding the key problems and approaches to spatial problems in epidemiology and public health.  Through reading historical and contemporary examples of spatial analysis in public health, completing hands-on labs that give a sense of how key mechanisms and methods work, and pursuing an independent research project, you be able to identify the most important biological, social and environmental mechanisms that drive spatial patterns of risk. You will be able to answer key questions about the relevant spatial scale of analysis for a given problem (e.g. neighborhoods vs. cities) and identify key spatial statistics for characterizing spatial clustering relevant to your public health topics of interest.  At the end of this term, you will have a strong foundation for pursuing additional study of specific topics in spatial epidemiology, advanced statistical methods relevant to spatial analysis, and the creation of maps and other data visualizations that effectively convey these ideas.\nPlease see the course syllabus for detailed information on class meetings and assignments."

    "text": "I believe strongly that this course is a collaborative endeavor, and that the primary objective of this class is to help you clarify and achieve your own academic and professional goals. Our course policies are developed with that in mind and with the goal of creating an environment of mutual respect that also fosters intellectual exploration, creativity and productive risk-taking. If at any point you feel that these goals are not being met, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly.\n\n\nThis class will be held in-person and students are asked and expected to attend in-person whenever possible. If you do need to miss class for whatever reason, please let me know ahead of time so that we can plan accordingly.\nI will record each class session using Zoom and make the link to these recordings available to the entire class. When we have a guest speaker, these sessions will be recorded if the visiting speaker consents.\nIf you are unable to attend in person but can join via Zoom, that will be an option. However, since the class is heavily focused on discussion, in-class activities, and project work, the utility of these recordings and remote participation will be limited primarily to listening to and reviewing the lecture portions of the class.\n\n\n\nDue dates for assignments have been chosen to ensure that there is enough time to give detailed feedback prior to the due date for the next assignment. However, I know that life often intervenes in the form of either personal obligations or other assignments which can make it difficult to get every assignment in on time. If you do not anticipate being able to make a due date, please let me know as far ahead of time as possible so that we can arrange an extension.\n\n\n\nI believe that detailed, qualitative feedback from instructors and peers is far more useful than numerical grading. Numerical grading schemes disincentivize exploration and risk-taking, rewarding consistency over the course of a term over growth. Assignment assessments and final grades for this course are constructed with the goal of facilitating growth and exploration within a student-centered environment. This, of course, entails a slightly different set of expectations and responsibilities for students and instructors than in a course following a classic grading/assessment scheme.\n\n\n\nThere will be no numerical or letter grades given for written assignments or presentations, including the final product of your semester-long project. Instead, you will receive written feedback from me on each assignment, and will also have a number of opportunities to share your ideas and receive constructive feedback from your classmates.\nThis will include in-class presentations on your research topic, structured peer-reviews of work-in-progress, in-class ‘workshop’ time to work with your project group and get advice from me and your classmates, as well as periodic self-assessments that you will submit to me.\nFollowing fall break, I will ask you to submit responses to a midterm check-in survey, which will allow me to better understand what is working and not working for you in the class so that we can make adjustments for the second half of the term.\n\n[!NOTE] For peer and self-assessments, I will provide a template containing an outline of the areas I am asking you to give feedback on. These assessment opportunities are meant to help keep you on track and to flag individual and collective issues (i.e. unclear assignment instructions, questions about assignment topics, format, etc. as they arise).\n\n\n\n\nFinal course grades will be self-assigned and based on each student’s assessment of their progress towards their self-identified goals as well as those identified by me over the course of the term. I reserve the right to revise final grades upwards or downwards if necessary, but will only do this only in rare cases where a student’s self-assessed grade is strongly out of alignment with my perception of their performance in the course, and in all others will take the student’s self-assessed grade as-is.\n\n[!IMPORTANT] The primary factors that would result in a downward revision of a student’s self-assessed grade are 1) chronic, unexplained lateness in turning in assignments or not completing assignments, 2) instances of academic dishonesty.\n\nWhile consistent in-person attendance is expected, I understand that personal, professional and academic circumstances may periodically impact your ability to attend either in-person or remotely. I will not take attendance during regular course sessions and an excused absence is not required on most days.\n\n[!WARNING] However, on days when students are presenting and giving/receiving feedback, attendance or an excused absence is required and unexplained/excused absence may result in a downward revision of your final grade. This requirement reflects a recognition that on these days of class, individual attendance impacts all course members.\n\nStudents are also welcome to take the course under the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) grading scheme offered by SPH if desired."

    "text": "With your problem clearly defined in your [[What is the origin?|origin]] assignment, the next step is to describe in concrete terms what it would look like if your problem was solved or at least meaningfully addressed. This could be reducing incidence of a particular disease in a community, increasing knowledge of risk and protective factors among at-risk individuals, or closing a gap in scientific knowledge of the problem, or something else you identify as being important.\nIn other words, I am asking you to identify a concrete target for improvement in your problem. This could be quantitative, e.g. a 10% reduction in risk of death from cardiovascular disease in a given community, or something more qualitative. For example, if your identified problem is around a knowledge or data gap rather than reducing disease incidence, it could be focused on developing a scientific study or evaluation project to understand the mechanisms driving your outcome.\nThis assignment will take the form of an in-class presentation prior to the mid-term break in late February in which you will outline the problem and argue for its importance based on your work in the “[[What is the origin?]]” project and feedback from me on this work, and then present your target for improvement based on your research and understanding of what has already been tried in this area."

    "text": "Roadmap Project\nThroughout the term, you will complete a project in which you identify a problem of interest to you in spatial epidemiology and plot a path towards solving it. You will build and receive feedback on this project from me and your peers over the course of the term. In keeping with the spatial theme of the course, we will call this the Roadmap project because you will be asked to chart your own path from a spatial problem to a solution to the problem you have identified.\nThe nature of the problem and solution are up to you, but we will all approach it with the objective of being able to apply all of the following skills by the time you complete the project.\nAlthough a lot of the work on this project will be done outside of our course meetings, we will devote several class sessions to working on and presenting materials developed through completing the steps of this project. The stages of this project will address all of the course goals, with a particular focus on the fourth one - focused on integrating different sources of information on a spatial problem in epidemiology - via the final product of this semester-long project.\n\nProject Stages\nYou will build towards the final project in stages over the course of the term through the following four sub-assignments:\n\nWhat is the origin?\nWhat is the destination?\nPostcard from the road\nFinal Product\n\n\n\nAssessment and Grading\nYou will be evaluating your own progress and the match between what you were able to accomplish and your goals at the outset. The point of having this be self-assessed is to make sure you pick something that is of interest and use to you, not what you imagine what I want from you. Please spend some time thinking about how this project could best address your short- and long-term academic and career goals.\nThis could be anything from learning a new analytical skill, deepening your knowledge about a particular epidemiological topic or set of policy/practice tools.\nI encourage you to think about other uses for the final product of this semester-long project: How could you use it to lay the foundation for a fellowship application, create a portfolio to showcase your work to potential employers, or do anything else that is important to you?\nFor example, your final product could include any of the following:\n\nA podcast episode introducing your topic and some of your ideas/research on it.\nA spatial data visualization with accompanying explanation; can be presented in the form of a set of social media posts, a blog entry, or as a printed document.\nA policy white paper meant to inform public and political debate around issues related to your problem of choice.\nA pamphlet or some other type of public health communication meant to be shared in practice setting, e.g. in a clinic, during outreach, etc.\n\nIt could also very well be something not on this list - you just need to justify why you are taking the approach you choose."

The purpose of this assignment is for you to build a useful reference for yourself that can inform work on your project going forward. Over the course of the term, you will build this reference to form a coherent plan for your final product.\nThink of this as being more like a well-annotated lab notebook or a portfolio than a formal research paper. It should still be well-documented and clearly written, but can include different sources of content including references to academic papers, news articles, video clips, and anything else you think is relevant or important for understanding your topic.\n\nDefining your problem\nYou should define your problem with as much specificity as possible. For example, if you are interested in Tuberculosis (TB), rather than discussing spatial variation of TB infection at a very high level, focus on the problem of TB in a specific city or region. Making things concrete will be key for keeping your project focused and making it useful and interesting to you.\n\n\nLearning Objective\nYour work on this project will give you the opportunity to refine and demonstrate your skills relating to the [[Identify well-posed spatial problems in public health and epidemiology.|identification of well-posed spatial public health problems]].\n\nSubmission\nPlease submit this assignment via Canvas any time between now (1/18) and midnight on 1/28."

Specifically, we will look at how this particular outbreak was shaped by the confluence of biological, social, and environmental mechanisms.\nAnother important component of this story is one of problem definition: Is the problem transmission of an infectious pathogen, or the spatial aggregation of foul-smelling, disease-causing air?\nDuring this module, we will use Snow’s challenges in convincing a skeptical public and medical establishment of the infectious etiology of Cholera as a springboard for the type of problem definition that is the focus of the [[What is the destination?]] assignment.
