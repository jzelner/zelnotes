# Measuring residential segregation and its consequences for health

In this session, we will focus on the quantitative complement to the more-qualitative analysis of residential segregation and infectious disease presented in [@roberts2009].

Speficially, during class we will briefly discuss the readings as well as some of the key measures used to characterize residential segregation. We will complete the following two hands-on exercises (time-permitting):

1. [Comparing measures of spatial segregation and clustering.](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/spatial_segregation)
2. [Examining the mechanistic implications of residential segregation for infection inequity.](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/segregation-transmission/) (If time ‚è≥)
