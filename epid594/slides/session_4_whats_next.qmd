{{< include _titleslide.qmd >}}

## Agenda

- Check in about projects/timeline

- What does it mean to *do* spatial epidemiology in the real world?

- Hands-on activity: Mapping and analyzing spatial clustering in the radon data

- Wrapping up! ü•≤

## Final Products 

- Due 3/14 *or* 3/21?

- Please remember to include your self-assessment and grade.

- Happy to check in at any point prior to handing it in.

## How do we make spatial analysis useful in the real world?

## Small-group discussion

In groups of 3-4:

- How has your understanding of what spatial epidemiology is changed since the beginning of 592?

- What are you most interested in going forward?

- What concepts or ideas are still confusing or bugging you?

# Wrap-up

## Sometimes spatial epidemiology is a perspective more than a specific result

![Aggregating across spatial scales obscures clustering of non-vaccination that leads to VPD outbreak risk (from @masters2020)](vaccine_waivers.png)

## Picking the wrong scale of surveillance can lead to predictions that are way off

![Predictions of outbreak size get worse as spatial aggregation becomes more extreme (from @masters2020)](scale.png)

## Spatial epidemiology's strength comes from its <span class="alert">integrative</span> nature

![Pipeline from data and theory to epidemiological models (from @zelner2022b)](epimodels.png)

## Effective spatial epidemiology is focused on understanding how community context and ecology impact risk
