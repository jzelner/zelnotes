## Agenda

- <span class="alert">Final project</span> timeline
- Discussing the <span class="alert">laws of health geography</span>
- Hands-on <span class="alert">smoothing</span> activity

## Final Project

- Final form of your project is <span class="alert">up to you</span>.

- Please feel free to continue with your 592 topic if that is of interest! 

- Weekly project checkpoints are there to make sure you are able to make progress in the (<span class="alert">limited</span>) time we have.

- Ultimately, I want you to do what is most <span class="alert">useful</span> and interesting for you.

## The "First Law" of Geography {.quote .center}

## Why is the first law useful? {.quote .center}

<figure>
<blockquote>
"[I]magine a world in which [TFL] is not true. In such a world, the full range of conditions could be encountered in every minute portion of the world. <span class="alert">Every room, for example, might contain the full observed range of the Earthâ€™s topographic variation, from the bottom of the Marianas Trench to the summit of Mount Everest[.]</span>

## "A world of white noise" {.imgslide}

"White noise" has lots of variation with little autocorrelation.

## More to the story?

Goodchild argues that:

- *Variation* is more fundamental than *autocorrelation*.
- Without spatial variation there is only perfect autocorrelation.
- Maybe *variation* needs to be the real First Law?
- Doesn't discount role of correlation, just puts them in order.

## What is <span class="alert">smoothing</span>?

<p style="text-align: center;"> Smoothing lets us separate signal from noise.</p>

## What are some examples of epidemiological <span class="alert">signals</span>?

- Causal <span class="alert">relationship</span> between a risk factor and an outcome.
- Trend in a <span class="alert">time series</span>
- Disease <span class="alert">hotspot</span> in a spatial dataset.

## What are some sources of <span class="alert">noise</span> we might encounter in epidemiological data?

- Random variation, i.e. <span class="alert">process noise</span>.
- Observation <span class="alert">error</span>.
- Exposure <span class="alert">misclassification</span>.

## A hands-on example

Using a measure like *Moran's I* this is <span class="alert">anti</span- correlated, but we can see qualitatively that there is more going on.
