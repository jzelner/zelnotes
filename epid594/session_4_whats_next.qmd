# Measuring residential segregation and its consequences for health

In this session, we will focus on understanding what is around the bend in spatial epidemiology and how to make it most relevant to real-world practice and applied research.

We will also complete a second hands-on activity taking a more spatial perspective on the [radon data](/posts/spatial_radon/index.html) from @gelman2006.
