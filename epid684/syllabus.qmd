# Syllabus 

We will have 28 total class meetings, which we will use for a mix of discussion, hands-on activities and project work. The topics we focus on in our in-class sessions are selected to support your own work on the semester-long [Roadmap Project](roadmap-project/index.qmd)

This semester, we will meet in SPH I 2695 from 1:30-2:50pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning 1/5. If you are unable to attend class in-person, please use this [zoom link](https://umich.zoom.us/j/99504833290) to participate remotely.

Please review the [course policies](policies.qmd) for information about attendance, grading and other issues.

## Module 1: What are the ingredients of a spatial problem in epidemiology?

In this first module, we will start to get our heads around what we actually mean when we talk about spatial epidemiology. First and foremost, we'll ask the question of *why* space matters in public health, *when* it does and does not, and what tools are available to us to diagnose and address spatial problems where they exist.

1. Where are we going?  (1/5)  
2. Maps and More  (1/10)  
3. Spatial epidemiology is all about relationships]]  (1/12)  
4. [What tools can we use to understand spatial variation and clustering?](class_4_spatial_variation.qmd) (1/17)

## Module 2: Spatial analysis and the foundations of modern epidemiology. (Sessions 5-11)

In this module, we will use an important but often-mischaracterized historical example - the 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak and John Snow's historic analysis and intervention in it - to explore what it is that makes a public health problem a spatial one. Specifically, we will look at how this particular outbreak was shaped by the confluence of biological, social, and environmental mechanisms. 

Another important component of this story is one of problem definition: Is the problem transmission of an infectious pathogen, or the spatial aggregation of foul-smelling, disease-causing air? 

During this module, we will use Snow's challenges in convincing a skeptical public and medical establishment of the infectious etiology of Cholera as a springboard for the type of problem definition that is the focus of the [[What is the destination?]] assignment. This will culminate in presentations at the end of this module, and we will use some of the class time prior to these presentations to make progress on this project.

1. Walking into a Cholera epidemic  (1/19)  
2. Miasma vs. Germ Theory  (1/24)  
3. Using maps to make the case for an infectious cause (1/26)  
4. From the pump handle to the present  (1/31)
