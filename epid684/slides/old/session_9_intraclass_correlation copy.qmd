## Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="/images/merlo_sim_data.png">

How can we characterize the relative importance of <span class="alert">individual</span> vs. <span class="alert">contextual</span> drivers of variation?

## Agenda

- Walk through the intraclass correlation example from [@merlo2005]

- Discuss what we learn from focusing on places vs. spaces as in [@chaix2005]


## What is intraclass correlation?

- A measure of <span class="alert">global</span> clustering.

- Measures the amount of the <span class="alert">total variance</span> in an outcome that is clustered within vs. between <span class="alert">groups</span>

- Groups can include households, neighborhoods, cities, etc.

- ICC is useful when there is individual-level and spatial variation but it is not clear which is <span class="alert">most important</span>

## What is variance?

- <span class="alert">Square</span> of the average deviation from the mean

- So, if standard deviation: $\sigma$ = 10$, Variance: $\sigma^2$ = 100.

## The total variance is the <span class="alert">sum</span> of the within- and between-group variances

$$
\sigma^2_{Total}=\sigma^2_N+\sigma^2_I
$$

- $\sigma^2_N$ = \alert{Between-neighborhood} variance in outcomes.

- $\sigma^2_I$ = Individual level variance in outcomes (\alert{within-neighborhood} variation)

## We can then use these to calculate the ICC

$$
ICC=\frac{\sigma_{N}^2}{\sigma_{N}^2+\sigma_{I}^2}
$$

In words: the ICC is the proportion of the total variation in the outcome that occurs *within* the units we care about.

## A worked example

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true 

require(ggplot2)

mu_pop <- 120

sigma_pop <- 5

sigma_neighborhood <- 3

J <- 10
N <- 100

neighborhoods <- rep(1:J, N)

neighborhood_means <- rnorm(J, mu_pop, sqrt(sigma_neighborhood))

ind_sbp <- rnorm(N*J, neighborhood_means[neighborhoods], sqrt(sigma_pop))

hg <- ggplot(data.frame(x=ind_sbp)) + geom_histogram(aes(x=x), binwidth=0.5, colour = "black", fill = "white") + theme_bw() + 
geom_vline(xintercept = mean(ind_sbp), linetype = "dashed") +
xlab("Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)") +
ylab("N")
plot(hg)
```


500 observations of blood pressure with $\bar{x}$ = 120, $\sigma^2$ = 8

## Plotting by neighborhood shows that there is more than just <span class="alert">individual</span> variation {.imgslide}

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true 
sbp_limits <- c(min(ind_sbp)-3, max(ind_sbp)+3) 
ig <- ggplot() +
geom_point(data = data.frame(x=as.factor(neighborhoods), y = ind_sbp), aes(x=x,y=y, colour = x)) + 
xlab("Neighborhood") +
ylab("Individual SBP") +
theme_bw() +
theme(legend.position = "none") +
ylim(sbp_limits)
plot(ig)
```


## Use <span class="alert">neighborhood means</span> to estimate between-neighborhood variance

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true 

## Make a plot of neighborhood means, ordered from least to greatest

ig2 <- ggplot() +
geom_point(data = data.frame(x=as.factor(neighborhoods), y = ind_sbp), aes(x=x,y=y, colour = x)) + 
geom_point(data = data.frame(x=as.factor(1:J), y = neighborhood_means), aes(x=x,y=y), shape = "x", size = 5) +
xlab("Neighborhood") +
ylab("Individual SBP") +
theme_bw() +
theme(legend.position = "none") +
ylim(sbp_limits)
plot(ig2)
```

## We can use this information to calculate the ICC

- Total Variance = 8

- Neighborhood Variance = 3

- Individual Variance = Total - Neighborhood = 5

- ICC = $\frac{\text{individual variance}}{\text{total variance}}$ = .375

## What does that mean?

- About 38% of variation in SBP outcomes is attributable to neighborhood.

- Seems like a lot, but importance is ultimately relative to the what biological and public health mechanisms are of interest.

- Provides a <span class="alert">basis for comparison</span> with other locations.

## Preparing for <span class="alert">What is the destination?</span> presentations

- Why are we doing this?

- How should you prepare?

## Effective <span class="alert">communication</span> of spatial questions and analyses is central to the goals of this course.

- Identify well-posed spatial problems in public health and epidemiology.

- Articulate concrete, informed, goals for spatially-focused public health interventions and research.

- Suggest appropriate theoretical and analytic frameworks for understanding spatial variation in public health problems and interventions and policies meant to ameliorate them.

## Since these are <span class="alert">difficult</span> and <span class="alert">complex</span> problems, good feedback is essential to getting your message across {.imgslide}

What does this trolley have to do with feedback? Let me tell you a story...

## What does helpful feedback <span class="alert">do</span>? {.imgslide}

Generate insights that facilitate <span class="alert">improvement</span> or <span class="alert">growth</span> in the topic at hand

## What makes for <span class="alert">helpful</span> feedback?

- Take the perspective of a peer or member of the intended audience who wants to learn about the topic, rather than a teacher/evaluator with an interest in finding <span class="alert">flaws</span>.

- Start by really trying to understand what your partner is <span class="alert">trying to acheive</span>. 

- Be <span class="alert">specific</span> in your feedback and keep it close to the paper you're reading.

- Ask questions: If something doesn't make sense, explain what about it is confusing and ask what they were trying to accomplish. 

- Flag things you find interesting as well as those that are unclear. Knowing what is working is as or <span class="alert">more</span> important than knowing what isn't.

- Suggest resources or ideas that might help your partner advance their project.
