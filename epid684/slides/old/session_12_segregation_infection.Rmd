# Agenda

>- Defining and discussing some <span class="alert">measures</span> of residential segregation.
>- Hands-on activity exploring <span class="alert">mechanistic</span> relationships between segregation and infectious disease transmission.

# What is the *isolation* index?

Often defined as the proportion of contacts an individual in a *minority* group in a population has with members of that same group.

# Sometimes paired with the <span class="alert">interaction</span> index

Interaction quantifies the proportion of *minority* group member's contacts that occur with the *majority* group.

# What are these indices used for? 

>- Quantify the intensity of residential segregation. 

>- Measure exposure of potentially infectious individuals to susceptible individuals.

>- Describe the distribution of plant species across a geographic area.

# How do you measure isolation?

$$
Z = \sum_{i} \frac{a_{i}}{A} \frac{a_{i}}{n_i}
$$

Where:

- $a_i$: Number of minority  members in area $i$
- $b_i$: Number of majority group members in area $i$
- $A$ total number of minority group members
- $B$ total number of majority group members, where $A < B$.
- $n_i$ number individuals in area $i$, i.e. $a_i + b_i$

# How do you measure interaction?

$$
Z = \sum_{i} \frac{a_{i}}{A} \frac{b_{i}}{n_i}
$$

Where:

- $a_i$: Number of minority  members in area $i$
- $b_i$: Number of majority group members in area $i$
- $A$ total number of minority group members
- $B$ total number of majority group members, where $A < B$.
- $n_i$ number individuals in area $i$, i.e. $a_i + b_i$
