# Agenda

>- Ingredients of a successful short talk
>- Time to work on projects
>- In-class office hours


# Slide headers should be short, clear <span class="alert">statements</span> 

>- Header says it all
>- This makes it easy for folks to follow what you're doing.
>- Assume everyone will <span class="alert">tune out</span> at some point and need to be re-oriented.
>- More importantly, this makes it easy for <span class="alert">you</span> to get a feel for the flow of your presentation.

# Choose <span class="alert">simple images</span> that make your point easier to digest {.imgslide}

# Try to keep your <span class="alert">notes</span> off your slides

>- Use the space on your slide to show something that <span class="alert">complements</span> what you're saying rather than just saying it.

>- In other words, don't do what I just did ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

# Give your content room to <span class="alert">breathe</span> üå¨Ô∏è

>- Assume it will take you at least 1m per slide. 

>- Almost always better to go short than long.

>- You will almost never go short even if you think you will.

# This is an opportunity for you to articulate your ideas and get feedback.

>- Not a <span class="alert">high-stakes</span> exercise.
>- Could actually be <span class="alert">fun</span>, maybe?
>- Check out this [great paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009554) for more ideas/resources.
