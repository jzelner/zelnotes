# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.quoteslide}

What are the mechanistic linkages between residential segregation and infection outcomes?

# Agenda

>- Brief overview of infectious disease <span class="alert">transmission models</span>

>- Hands-on with mechanisms discussed in Acevedo-Garcia paper.

>- Discussion of the cyclical nature of residential segregation and disease.

# What does it mean to <span class="alert">model</span> infectious disease transmission? {.imgslide}

>- Represent <span class="alert">change over time</span> in disease outcomes.

>- Explore <span class="alert">possible futures</span> if key parameters such as $R_0$ are changed.

>- $R_0$ = the <span class="alert">average</span> number of new infections generated by a single case in a <span class="alert">fully susceptible</span> population.

>- In general, $R_0 > 1 \to$ outbreak/epidemic.

# What <span class="alert">goes into</span> a parameter like $R_0$? {.imgslide}

# Taking the <span class="alert">long view</span> on segregation and infection

>- What examples of infection <span class="alert">reinforcing</span> segregation do Finn and Kobayashi draw on? 

>- To what extent have the concerns they raise about pandemic restrictions as a tool of authoritarianism and apartheid come to pass?  Globally? Domestically?

>- What role can <span class="alert">spatial epidemiologists</span> play in preventing this cycle from persisting?
