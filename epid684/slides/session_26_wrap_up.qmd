## Agenda

 - What is spatial epidemiology?

- Passing some insight to the next generation of students.

- Projects

## What is spatial epidemiology anyway?

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

- My major goal of this term was to finish with a better sense of this than when we started

- Also to help/encourage you to integrate these ideas into your own work.

- How did we do?

## An AI ü§ñ Augmented tour of spatial epidemiology

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Presents an interesting qualitative summary of ideas/images out there on the topic.
- Fun (if you like that sort of thing)
- More productive than making random images of dogs doing silly things.

## John Snow's hands-on approach was key to his success

  <blockquote style="font-size:0.7em;">
      "He sits alone in his cluttered flat, <span style="color:green">frogs croaking</span> üê∏ around him, illuminated only by candlelight. After a few minutes tinkering...he fastens the mouthpiece over his face and releases the gas. Within seconds, his head hits the desk. Then minutes later, he wakes, consults his watch through blurre vision. He reaches for his pen, and starts recording the data."</blockquote>

"What we do experience are large and complex sets of interacting problems, dynamic <span class="alert">systems</span> of problems... [W]e refer to these as messes. Our focus is on the <span class = "alert">management</span> of messes rather than the solution of problems."

## The future of spatial epidemiology needs to be dominated by better ideas and not just new technologies

## This is where I need your help {.smaller}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Spatial epidemiology sometimes comes across as very technical and inaccessible.

- One goal with this course was to debunk that a bit while also introducing you to some of the tools.

- I recently wrote a [blog post](https://zelnotes.io/posts/invitation-to-spatial-epidemiology/) about this for people who want to try their hand at spatial analysis but are intimidated for one reason or another.
- <span class="alert">But:</span> The piece is missing a final diagram that is the counterpoint to this one showing what spatial epid. actually is üëâ
- Asking you to help me build a more accurate diagram that reflects your experiences and the ideas in the piece.

## That's it! 

- Feel free to stay and work on projects/chat for the rest of today. 
  
- Please submit <span class="alert">final products</span> including brief (1-2 para) self-assessment and self-grade by 4/26.

- Stay in touch!
