## Agenda

- What is this a class about?

- Introductions 

- Review structure of the course and key assignments

- Discuss expectations/evaluation

- Questions

## Who am I?

- Associate Professor of Epidemiology at UM 

- Core faculty member in the *Center for Social Epidemiology and Population Health* (CSEPH)

- Research group focused on social and spatial epidemiology of infectious disease ([epibayes.io](https://epibayes.io))

- PhD in Sociology and Public Policy from UM (2011)

- Also teach undergrad courses on the social history of infectious disease (PUBHLTH 405) and online spatial epid. courses (EPID 592/594) 

## My goals for this course

By the end of this term you will:

1. Become effective in the application of spatial ideas to real-world problems in epidemiology.

2. Be able to apply a spatial systems approach to public health.

3. Learn how to select appropriate quantitative tools for addressing spatial public health problems.

4. Understand how to use spatial analysis as a tool for advancing <span class="alert">health justice</span> and <span class="alert">equity</span>.

## What makes an epidemiological problem <span class="alert">meaningfully</span> spatial?

<span class="alert">Spend a few minutes answering the questions in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3EmUPFAsaaq0_DMhFrV0FDKM-RxKQjks8pMEZ0tpu4/edit?usp=sharing):</span> 

- What do you think the <span class="alert">value</span> of spatial analysis is for you in your academic or professional role (e.g. epidemiologist)?

- What topics or methods are you most interested in learning about?

- Any üî• burning questions üî• about the topic or class that I can answer?

## My take: <span class="alert">Relationships</span> are at the heart of spatial analysis

- <span class="alert">Distance</span> is a stand-in for all the things that often make near things more similar and far things less similar.

- For example: environmental exposures, social and political factors, patterns of movement, built environment.

- Shares a lot of ideas with longitudinal and network analysis.

- Necessarily highly <span class="alert">interdisciplinary</span> and open to a wide range of approaches.

## Spatial relationships are often physical reflections of social ones

## Our key focus in this class is on how spatialized <span class="alert">processes</span> generate spatial patterns

## That's great, but what are we actually going to *do* this term?

- [Syllabus](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/EPID684/Winter+2023+Syllabus)

## Next Time

- Digging into some of the [key ideas and tools of spatial epidemiology](https://publish.obsidian.md/epibayes/Courses/EPID684/modules/Module+1/Sessions/2.+Maps+and+More) in more detail.
