## Agenda

- Introductions

- What does it mean to model for equity?

- Lunch ü•™

- Short talks/discussion on respiratory infection equity work 

## We have made good progress on conceptualizing and analyzing infection (in)equity

- ["Racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality are driven by unequal infection risks."](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/5/e88/5998295) (CID, 2021)

- "[There are no equal opportunity infectors"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009795) (PLOS Comp. Bio, 2022)

- ["To make long-term gains against infection inequity, infectious disease epidemiology needs to develop a more sociological imagination."](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/192/7/1047/7056289?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (AJE, 2023)

- ["Modeling rates of disease with missing categorical data."](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08161) (Annals of Applied Statistics, Forthcoming)

## <span class="alert">Modeling for equity</span>: A three-legged stool 

1. Ask questions that foreground macro-structural mechanisms and <span class="alert">power</span> differentials.

2. Collect <span class="alert">data</span> that are up to the task of answering these question.

3. Construct models that examine potential impacts of <span class="alert">socio-structural change</span> on disease even if these changes don't correspond to a formal policy or intervention.

## Equity-oriented models take <span class="alert">social mechanisms</span> as seriously as biological ones. {.quote}

<blockquote>
  COVID-19 disparities are not the fault of those who are experiencing them, but rather reflect social policies and
  systems that create health disparities in good times and inflate them in a crisis. <span class="alert">The US must develop a new kind of
  ‚Äúherd immunity,‚Äù whereby resistance to the spread of poor health in the population occurs when a sufficiently high
  proportion of individuals, across all racial, ethnic, and social class groups, are protected from and thus ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to
  negative social determinants.</span>
</blockquote>
 From Williams & Cooper, ["COVID-19 and Health Equity‚ÄîA New Kind of ‚ÄúHerd Immunity‚Äù](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2766096), JAMA, 6/23/2020

## Equity-oriented models require an informed understanding of the <span class="alert">connections between</span> high-level, intermediary, and proximal causes of infection.

## Equity-oriented models cannot treat race and other social categorizations as <span class="alert">causal variables</span>.

## Equity-oriented models must use comparisons that reflect the impact of <span class="alert">structural changes</span> on disease risk.

## Next step is to translate these ideas into useful models

Some goal-setting questions can be found in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFxWDkwONLuJ0a8Jom8rQ2aPTOOSjpVSX_FR1keuwCU/edit?usp=sharing). Specifically:

1. What do you see as key *conceptual* challenges in going from theory to useful models of infection inequity?

2. What are the data gaps that need to be closed? How close-able are they?
   
3. What are some of the *organizational* or *institutional* impediments to making necessary change?


## There be dragons üêâ

- Models that encode biased assumptions may be worse than those that ignore equity altogether.

- Nonexistent data on individual socioeconomic status in most public health surveillance data.

- Datasets are plagued by missingness of key socio-demographic covariates. [@trangucci2022]

- Career/funding incentives have not been well-aligned.

- Modelers from marginalized backgrounds remain underrepresented.

## Next 

- 1-2ish: Lunch
- 2-4: Covid excess mortality and vaccination patterns (Krzysztof, Kelly & Reiden)
- 4-5: Decedent Viral Testing (Andrew Brouwer)
