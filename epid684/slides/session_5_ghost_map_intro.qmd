# Agenda

>- Continue working on diagramming/mapping "Origin" systems

      "He sits alone in his cluttered flat, <span style="color:green">frogs croaking</span> around him, illuminated only by candlelight. After a few minutes tinkering...he fastens the mouthpiece over his face and releases the gas. Within seconds, his head hits the desk. Then minutes later, he wakes, consults his watch through blurre vision. He reaches for his pen, and starts recording the data."</blockquote></div>

# Some Discussion Questions

>- What struck you most about the introductory chapters? Specific passages?
>- What - if any - parallels do you potentially see to the present day?
>- Anything confusing?

# A quote I love from *The Ghost Map* {.quote}

<blockquote>
"Most world-historic events - great military battles, political revolutions - are self-consciously historic to the
participants living through them. They act knowing that their decisions will be chronicled and dissected for decades or
centuries to come. But <span class="alert">epidemics create a kind of history from below</span>: they can be world-changing, but the
participants are almost inevitably ordinary folk, following their established routines, not thinking for a second about
how their actions will be recorded for posterity." (From *The Ghost Map*, p. 32)
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1em;" class="fragment">
  <span class="alert">But:</span> Is this still true?

# Urbanization closed the loop of the ðŸ’© $\to$ ðŸš° cycle {.quote}

<blockquote style="font-size: 0.7em;">
"What the Vibrio cholerae bacterium desires, more than anything, is an environment in which human beings have a regular habit of eating other people's excrement." (p.40)

  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if we spent the proposed funds to install sewage infrastructure in London only to find
    cholera cases don&#39;t decline in this 1854 epidemic? For the costs that businesses would bear, all they would gain
    is drinking water free from human excrement.</p>&mdash; Neoliberal John Snow (@NeoliberalSnow) <a

# A spatial systems perspective on your <span class="alert">problem</span> topic.

Continue:

>- Thinking through the components of your system.
>- Characterizing the <span class="alert">relationships</span> between these components.
>- Diagramming out these relationships using the approach from the Diez Roux et al. paper.
>- Focus on *simplicity*, i.e. if you don't think it needs to be there...it doesn't!
