## Agenda

- Discuss the <span class="alert">qualitative</span> dimensions of residential segregation.

- Looking at <span class="alert">interacting</span> dimensions of risk using the <span class="alert">index of concentration at the extremes </span> (üßä).

- Using a <span class="alert">hierarchical</span> approach to characterize multi-level patterns  of residential segregation.

- Smoothing pt. 2 (if ‚è∞...)

## <span class="alert">In small groups:</span> How would you characterize the patterning and causes of U.S. segregation <span class="alert">ca. 2022</span>?

- Take a look at the map of county-level segregation [here](https://belonging.gis-cdn.net/us_segregation_map/?year=2020).

- Read some of the (short) regional segregation stories.

- Pick an area that you are interested in/feel knowledgable about.

- Look at patterns of change <span class="alert">over time</span>.

- How does changing the <span class="alert">scale</span> impact what you see/learn from the map?


## What are the characteristics of segregation in the U.S.?

- A function of <span class="alert">local</span> and <span class="alert">regional</span> dynamics.

- Reflects the independent and <span class="alert">interacting</span> effects of racial discrimination and economic disparities [@bruch2006].

- Huge regional differences in the nature, causes, and intensity of residential segregation. 

- Obviously these dynamics stretch the ability of <span class="alert">very reductive</span> approaches to show us much that is meaningful.


## The <span style="color:#add8e6">ICE</span> üßä approach

- Capture the impact of <span class="alert">extremes</span>

- For wealth: $$\text{ICE}_i = \frac{A_i - P_i}{T_i}$$

- Where, $P_i$ = number of poor people in area $i$, $A_i$ number of affluent people, and $T_i$ is total number.

- Ranges from -1 to 1

- Can be extended to multiple groupings, i.e. number of wealthy individuals in advantaged race/ethnic group - number of poor individuals in disadvantaged race/ethnic group.

- What does the <span style="color:#add8e6">ICE</span> let us learn in the Feldman [@feldman2015] piece that we wouldn't have otherwise?

## Lichter and Parisi are trying to figure out how to deal with <span class="alert">multi-scale</span> segregation

![An example where segregation is primarily explained by *within-unit* variation. (from Lichter & Parisi [@lichter2015])](/images/lichter_low_macro.png)

## This requires dealing with both micro- and <span class="alert">macro-level</span> segregation at the same time

![A pattern of segregation dominated by between-unit variation [@lichter2015]](/images/lichter_high_macro.png)

## Can classic metrics of segregation capture <span class="alert">hierarchical</span> variation?

- Dissimilarity & Isolation only characterize variation *within* the lowest levels observed.

- Moran's I includes information on *proximity* or *adjacency* but is also only focused on lowest-level relationships.

- Lichter and Parisi [@lichter2015] use the Thiel index - an <span class="alert">entropy</span>-based measure - to characterize the overall intensity and scale of residential segregation.

## What is <span class="alert">entropy</span>?

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width=50%}
- Entropy ($E$) is a measure of <span class="alert">uncertainty</span> 

- Maximum value <span class="alert">$\to$</span> Maximum Uncertainty

- Minimum value <span class="alert"></span> Minimum Uncertainty
- For two groups: $$E = p \frac{1}{p} + (1-p)\frac{1}{1-p}$$

- Not limited to <span class="alert">binary</span> comparisons

```{r}

E <- p*log(1/p) + (1-p)*log(1/(1-p))

## <span class="alert">Thiel</span> index ($H$)

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A <span class="alert">weighted average</span> of differences in <span class="alert">entropy</span> between different levels.

- If $H=0$, the entropy within all lower-level units is equivalent to the population-level entropy. 

- In other words, all variation is <span class="alert">within-unit</span>.

- If $H=1$, the total amount of population-level entropy is explained by <span class="alert">between-unit</span> variation.
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
:::{.fragment}
$$
H_{B \in M} = \frac{1}{N_M E_M} \sum_{b=1}^{B}N_B(E_M-E_b) 
$$

Where:

- $N_M$ is the total population 
- $E_M$ is the entropy for the whole population
- $N_b$ is the population of small area $b$ 
- $E_b$ is the entropy of small area $b$
:::
:::
:::

## What does it mean for $H$ to be <span class="alert">decomposable</span>?

- $H$ is a sum over neighborhood-level differences from the population entropy.

- To see what the contribution of a given <span class="alert">level</span> is to the overall H, we just look at the sum over all smallest-level units in the one we care about.

- This lets us ask what proportion of the total $H$ in an area can be attributed to variation <span class="alert">within</span> and <span class="alert">between</span> different types of units within a metro area.

## Let's compare the <span class="alert">Theil</span> approach to the others

## So, what can we <span class="alert">learn</span> from this?

## Do the hierarchical and <span style="color:#add8e6">ICE</span> approaches help us with the <span class="alert">tyrrany of neighborhoods</span>? {.imgslide}

Can theses approaches help us pick more relevant scales of analysis? (Figure from [@petrovic2020])
