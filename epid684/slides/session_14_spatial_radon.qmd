Radon...in space!
 
## Agenda

- 'Postcards' logistics

- Air pollution exposure and mortality in Los Angeles

- Radon ‚ò¢Ô∏è lab üß™: Pt 2

## In groups of 2-3:

1. What is the major takeaway from this paper?

2. How many sources of data were employed? What were they?

3. How was spatial information included in the statistical modeling?

4. What concerns/critiques or questions do you have about this analysis?
