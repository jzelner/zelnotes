## Agenda

- Readings

- "Good Map ðŸ˜‡, Bad Map ðŸ‘¿"

- If time: Overview of Roadmap Project

## Making sense of today's readings 

- Did the Kirby piece impact your understanding of what spatial epidemiology is or isn't? How?

- Is the distinction between spatial epidemiology and <span class="alert">medical geography</span> made by Kirby et al. meaningful?

- Which of the <span class="alert">analytic tools</span> mentioned in this piece are most relevant to your own research or practice interests?

- Any points of confusion? Other questions?

## Roadmap Project

- Project is really focused on how to do something useful with spatial ideas and data in public health.

- Take a few minutes to look at the components of the assignment. 

- Think about some of the ideas in the Koch piece; are they relevant to what you are interested in doing?
