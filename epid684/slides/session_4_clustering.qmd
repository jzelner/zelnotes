## Agenda

- What is a <span style="color: red">hotspot</span> 🔥, anyway?.

- Discussing the idea of <span class="alert">kernel smoothing</span> and how it relates to Tobler's 1st Law.

- Hands-on with some smoothing models.

## <span class="alert">Why</span> might one undertake a cluster-based study?

- Public Health Response.

- Hypothesis testing.

- Identifying key <span class="alert">causal mechansisms</span>.

## Reasoning about clusters is <span class="alert">tricky</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="/images/texas_sharp_shooter.png" width="50%">

The Texas Sharpshooter 🎯 Problem is an example of a <span class="alert">logical fallacy</span> that can come up in the analysis of spatial clusters.

## What is a <span style="color: red">hotspot</span>? {.imgslide}

  </div>

  <span class="fragment">A hotspot is often in the eye of the beholder...</span>


## More detail is necessary to make the hotspot concept useful

> We recommend that the meaning of a “hotspot” be made *explicit* by use of an appropriate modifier such as: <span class="alert">“burden hotspot,”</span> to denote areas of elevated disease prevalence or incidence; “transmission” or <span class="alert">“risk hotspot,”</span> to denote areas of elevated transmission efficiency or a higher risk of disease acquisition; and <span class="alert">“emergence hotspot,”</span> to denote areas with an increased probability of disease emergence or reemergence. (Lessler et al., 2017)

## A cluster can represent multiple facets 💎 of risk

- Spatial aggregation of a disease <span class="alert">outcome</span>.

- Clustering of a specific <span class="alert">exposure risk</span>.

- Evidence of <span class="alert">social processes</span> that concentrate disadvantage and multiple risks.


# Kernel Smoothing

## Smoothing lets us separate signal 📡 from noise 📣

- What are some examples of a <span class="alert">spatial signal</span> or information?

- What are some possible sources of noise that could obscure the signal?

- What are some risks associated with mistaking noise $\to$ signal?
