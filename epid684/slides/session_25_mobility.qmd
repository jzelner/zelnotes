## Agenda

- What are the uses and challenges provided by üì± <span class="alert">mobility data</span> ?

- How can mobility data tell us about patterns of social <span class="alert">segregation</span> and inequality?

- Smoothing in 2D

##  Mobility data have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic  {.imgslide}

## What can mobility data capture that is <span class="alert">relevant</span> to understanding infectious disease transmission?

## Mobility data have revealed potential drivers of <span class="alert">inequities</span> in COVID-19 risk

![Changes in mobility by income decile in early 2020 in the U.S. from Chang et al. [@chang2020]](/images/chang_mobility_change.png)

## Income-related mobility differences reflect differential <span class="alert">occupational</span> exposures

## Have become important <span class="alert">inputs</span> to theoretical models

![Mobility data were used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under different housing policy scenarios in [@nande2021]](/images/nande_evictions_covid_transmission.png)

## Cell phone data come in different shapes and sizes

![Relationships between population covered and cellphone data type [@grantz2020]](/images/grantz_mobile_phone_levels.png)

## A lot of <span class="alert">processing</span> and analysis <span class="alert">choices</span> take place between data collection and use

## What might be worrisome about the rise of mobility data in epidemiology?

- Privacy üïµÔ∏è

- May drive technocratic vs. principled approaches to policy and decision-making

- Focus in on <span class="alert">micro factors</span> with sufficient attention to the macro drivers of micro behavior.

- Data may not be representative of variation in intensity and nature of contact.

- Simulation models built off of these data may appear more <span class="alert">authoritative</span> but have no more predictive usefulness than less-complex models.

# Mobility Neighborhood Disadvantage and COVID-19 ü¶† risk 

## What is the distinction between <span class="alert">residential</span> and <span class="alert">mobility</span> neighborhood disadvantage?

![How do Levy at all conceptualize the meaning of MND and RND for risk? [@levy2022]](/images/levy_rnd_vs_mnd.png)

## What is <span class="alert">triple neighborhood disadvantage</span>(TND)?

- Extends the concept of neighborhood disadvantage to include <span class="alert">connected</span> locations. 

- This includes neighborhood of residence, neighborhoods visited by people in a given location, and neighborhoods sending visitors to the neighborhood of interest.

- MND has been shown to be associated with increased violence risk after adjusting for RND [@levy2020; @sampson2020].

## MND predicts increased COVID-19 cases after adjustment for RND

![](/images/levy_nd_risks.png)

## MND & RND are strong - but <span class="alert">variable</span> - mediators of associations with race/ethnicty

![Mediation of neighborhood percent Black residents by RND, MND](/images/levy_rnd_mnd_mediation.png)

## These effects <span class="alert">vary</span> across groups

# <span class="alert">Smoothing</span> in 2 Dimensions üó∫Ô∏è

## Final hands-on!

<span class="alert">Also:</span> The last time you have to hear me talk about this Lisa Simpson video!
:::

## Next time

- Last class! (üç™)

- Come prepared with 1-3 references you think your classmates (present and future) should read.

- Will compile an <span class="alert">annotated bibliography</span> that I will post on the course site for your reference and for anyone else who might be interested. 

- Wrap-up discussion about <span class="alert">how the course went</span>.

- <span class="alert">Open office hrs</span> for balance of time for anyone who wants to check in about projects etc.
