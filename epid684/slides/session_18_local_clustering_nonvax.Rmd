# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="../images/olive_spatial_nonvax.png">

Measuring and understanding the public health implications of <span class="alert">spatially clustered</span> susceptibility through the lens of vaccine ðŸ’‰ hesitancy.

# Agenda

>- Review of global <span class="alert">Moran's I</span>

>- Measuring spatial clustering with simulated data <span class="alert">hands-on
</span>

>- Quick intro to <span class="alert">local Moran's I</span>

>- Discussion of Masters et al. paper on <span class="alert">policy</span> impacts on non-medical exemption rates and their clustering.


# Moran's I revisited

>- <span class="alert">Negative</span> values of *I* indicate that neighboring areas are more likely to be dissimilar to each other than non-neighboring ones.

>- <span class="alert">Positive</span> values indicate that neighboring values are more likely to be similar to each other. 

>- Can accomodate a range of ways of calculating values and distances, but here we'll stick to something simple.

# Really just a measure of <span class="alert">correlation</span>

Let's start with classic pearson correlation:

$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

<div class="fragment">
Can be interpreted as the ratio of the <span class="alert">covariance</span> of x and y to the product of their standard deviations:
$$ 
r = \frac{\text{cov(x,y)}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$
</div>

# Moran's I translates from correlation between two variable to <span class="alert">spatial autocorrelation</span>

$$
I = \frac{N}{W} \frac{\sum_{i} \sum_{j} w_{ij} (x_i - \bar{x}) (x_j - \bar{x}) }{\sum_{i}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$

Where:

>- N is the number of spatial areas & W is the sum of all the spatial \alert{weights}
>- $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the values of the i-th and j-th cells, $\bar{x}$ is the mean value of x across all squares
>- $w_{ij}$ indicates whether i & j are <span class="alert">neighbors</span> (yes = 1, no = 0 )
>- Only looking at <span class="alert">neighbors</span>: $w_{ij} = 0$ when $i = j$

# Moran's I translates from correlation between two variables to <span class="alert">spatial autocorrelation</span> in a single variable

$$
I = \frac{N}{W} \frac{\sum_{i}  \text{Covariance of x among neighbors of i} }{\text{Variance of x}}
$$

# Going hands-on {.imgslide}

<img src = "../images/cluster_measures_hands_on.png">

Relating spatial heterogeneity in non-vaccination to [measures of <span class="alert">global clustering</span>](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/spatial_segregation)

# Some questions

1. Which <span class="alert">level</span> of clustering has the strongest impact on the clustering measures?

2. Which <span class="alert">measure</span> seems to be most sensitive to small changes in the probability of non-vaccination clustering?

3. How sensitive are the results for <span class="alert">Moran's I</span> to the choice of â™œ's vs. â™›'s contiguity?

# Does making non-medical exemptions harder to get impact their prevalence?

>- How would you describe the impact of the 2015 rules change on the trajectory of NMEs in Michigan?

>- What do we lean from looking at the spatial clustering of NMEs in Michigan before and after the policy change?

>- Does the <span class="alert">spatial perspective</span> in this piece add to the overall argument?

# \alert{LISA} statistics provide estimates of clustering at individual locations {.imgslide}

Local clustering of philosophical non-medical exemptions to vaccination in Michigan. (From Masters et al., 2021)

# \alert{Local} Moran's I uses the values at each location instead of summing over all locations

$$
I_i = (x_i - \bar{x}) \sum_j w_{ij} (x_j - \bar{x})
$$

>- Can look at <span class="alert">high/high</span> (> 0), <span class="alert">low/low </span> (< 0) and <span class="alert">high/low</span> (>0, <0) clusters.

>- Approximate <span class="alert">significance</span> obtained by randomizing $x_i$ values, computing $I_i$ values at each location.

>- Should decide which type of cluster(s) are of interest <span class="alert">ahead of time</span>.
