# Today's <span class="alert">Theme</span> {.imgslide}

<img src="/images/cholera_galaxy_brain.jpg">

Mental models, past and <span class="alert">present</span> (or at least recent past...)

## Agenda

- "<span class="alert">Gold Standards</span>" and other scientific illusions ðŸ§™

- What did Chowkwanyun & Reed get right? Wrong?

- <span class="alert">If time:</span> Return of the <span class="alert">hotspot</span>.

## What do you think the implications of this (very) short story are for <span class="alert">you</span> and <span class="alert">your project</span>?

## What's old is new...
 
  In this paper, I have argued that both the long delays in replacing flawed, miasma-driven approaches to cholera prevention in the nineteenth century and long delays in replacing an exclusively contact-and-droplet model of SARS-CoV-2 prevention with one that includes airborne transmission in the twenty-first had a philosophical explanation in terms of which <span class="alert">mental models of reality</span> prevailed and the extent to which scientists and policymakers favoured <span class="alert">data over theory</span>. [@greenhalgh2021]

## <span class="alert">Intuition pumps</span> are stylized presentations of mental models {.smaller}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

As described by the philosopher Daniel Dennett:

  > Intuition pumps are cunningly designed [thought experiments, which] <span class="alert">focus the reader's attention on "the important" features</span>, and...deflect the reader from bogging down in hard-to-follow details. [@dennett2014]

## Well thought-out <span class="alert">mental models</span> let us:

  <li class = "fragment">Characterize <span class="alert">meaningful</span> relationships between physical environments, social environments, and health.</li>
  <li class = "fragment">Reveal the appropriate <span class="alert">scale</span> of analysis and intervention. </li>
  <li class="fragment">Explore the implications of geographically varying policies.</li>
  </ul>


## Why are <span class="alert">mental models</span> so critical to how we understand and intervene in epidemics?

- What is <span class="alert">evidence-based medicine</span>, and what is Greenhalgh's critique of its role in the COVID-19 pandemic?

- What weaknesses does she highlight in the Danamask RCT?

- What alternative sources of evidence does she argue should have been considered sooner?

## Small scale <span class="alert">spatial</span> data provided compelling evidence for the droplet theory of SARS-CoV-2 transmission {.imgslide}

<img src="/images/cdc_choir_practice.jpg">

Does this echo anything from *The Ghost Map*?

## Why didn't <span class="alert">mechanistic</span> evidence dislodge the droplet-only perspective on SARS-CoV-2 transmission? {.imgslide}

## EBM's hierarchy of evidence

- What is meant by 'risk of bias'?

- Quality of evidence?

- Where would Snow's explorations fit in this hierarchy?

## Reflecting on "Racial Health Disparities and Covid-19 â€” Caution and Context"

- What are Chowkwanyun and Reed's key concerns about the characterization of prevailing mental models of <span class="alert">racial health disparities</span>?

- How does spatial analysis figure into their concerns? Is there a world in which is it is part of the solution?

- What solutions do they propose? 

- To what extent have their worst-case predictions come to fruition?

## Next Time

- Starting to think about spatial vs. place-based approaches.
