## Agenda

- Against the culture of <span class="alert">null hypothesis significance testing</span>. ‚úä

- Radon ‚ò¢Ô∏è lab üß™ ! 

## On your own 

- What does Lash mean by the "culture of null hypothesis significance testing" (NHST)?

- What is <span class="alert">prior information</span>? How might including this information impact your parameter and uncertainty estimates?

- Anything confusing/surprising/particularly interesting in this reading?

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60, seconds = 0, play_sound=FALSE)
```

## In pairs

- What is a proposed alternative oritentation to over-focusing on NHST? 

- Are the ideas/arguments in here relevant to spatial analysis? Why or why not?

```{r}
library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 5, warn_when = 60, seconds = 0, play_sound=FALSE)
```
