# Miasmas and (spatial) mental models

Today's class is focused on taking the ideas from *The Ghost Map* into the present. 

## Before Class

### Readings

We will read one paper that gets into direct lessons from the Broad Street Outbreak [@greenhalgh2021], and a short opinion piece discussing the relationship between social disparities and spatial analysis [@chowkwanyun2020]. (Both are open-access and should be downloadable directly from the journal site.)

## During Class

We will finish our exploration of the concept of smoothing with a hands-on tutorial of hotspot detection using kernel density estimation in two dimensions.
