- To discuss a global clustering metric, we need to start w/the concept of a spatial weight, which quantifies the concept of a neighbor.
- We have discussed kernel functions, which are a version of this. 
- When our data are from specific *areas*, one way to approach things is to think in terms of neighbors.
