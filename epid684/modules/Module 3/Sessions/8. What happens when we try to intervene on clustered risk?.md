### Before Class
##### Reading
1. Masters NB, Zelner J, Delamater PL, et al. Evaluating Michiganâ€™s Administrative Rule Change on Nonmedical Vaccine Exemptions. _Pediatrics_. doi:[10.1542/peds.2021-049942](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-049942)
	- This paper is something of a sequel to the analysis of spatially clustered non-vaccination from [[7. Public health implications of spatially-clustered non-vaccination|last class]]. Specifically, this analysis looks at what happened to patterns of overall exemptions to vaccination and its spatial aggregation in the period after the administrative rule change making NMEs slightly harder to obtain in Michigan in 2015.

### During Class
We will complete [a hands-on exercise](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/spatial_segregation/) focused on understanding the implications of different approaches to measuring the spatially clustered susceptibility of the type described in the Masters et al. paper and other similar analyses.
