- [Adkins-Jackson PB, Chantarat T, Bailey ZD, Ponce NA. Measuring Structural Racism: A Guide for Epidemiologists and Other Health Researchers](https://www.dropbox.com/s/abuuhfp8ncapsxn/adkins-jackson_et_al_2021_measuring_structural_racism.pdf?dl=0). _American Journal of Epidemiology_. Published online September 25, 2021:kwab239. doi:[10.1093/aje/kwab239](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab239)
	- This piece offers a very helpful take on the challenges of characteristing the impacts of structural racism on health inequalities. To me, the most important contribution in this article is the detailed discussion of why those of us who complete analyses that talk about racial disparities in health outcomes can inadvertently perpetuate the structural determinants of health inequality we are supposedly trying to address.

- [Kershaw KN, Robinson WR, Gordon-Larsen P, et al. Association of Changes in Neighborhood-Level Racial Residential Segregation With Changes in Blood Pressure Among Black Adults: The CARDIA Study](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nx13o3tss7x3q5f/kershaw_et_al_2017_association_of_changes_in_neighborhood-level_racial_residential_segregation.pdf?dl=0). _JAMA Intern Med_. 2017;177(7):996-1002. doi:[10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.1226](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.1226)
	- This is a great study looking at the relationship between cumulative exposure to residential segregation and variation in blood pressure - as a proxy for cardiovascular disease risk - in Black adults in the U.S. This paper provides what I think is a very nice example of how you account for the complexity of something like residential history and its impacts on health outcomes, and their likely implications for social inequalities in health and illness.

#### During Class 

- We will start constructing a mind map of the various relationships between structural racism, economic inequality, and spatial variation in health and disease outcomes.
