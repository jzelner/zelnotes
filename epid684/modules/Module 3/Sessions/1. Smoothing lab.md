#### Before Class

Nothing, zilch, nada! Day off from readings!

#### During Class
- We will wrap up our discussion of the mind-mapping exercise from Tuesday.
- We will complete [a hands-on lab exercise](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/john-snow-cholera/) in which you will explore the Golden Square Cholera outbreak data first-hand and generate alternative maps of the *clustering* of Cholera in Golden Square using modern statistical analysis techniques.
- If time permits, we will go back through the first part of the smoothing hands-on from last week.

#### Additional Resources
- [Slides](https://jzelner.github.io/document-garden/epid684/session_9_lab_day.html) for this session
