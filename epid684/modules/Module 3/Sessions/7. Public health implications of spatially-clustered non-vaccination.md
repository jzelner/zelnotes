##### Reading
- [Olive JK, Hotez PJ, Damania A, Nolan MS. The state of the antivaccine movement in the United States: A focused examination of nonmedical exemptions in states and counties.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jlt4yw8xe40er78/olive_et_al_2018_the_state_of_the_antivaccine_movement_in_the_united_states.pdf?dl=0) _PLoS Med_. 2018;15(6):e1002578. doi:[10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578)
	- This paper provides an overview of the spatial issues at the heart of the risk posed by the anti-vaccine movement in the U.S. and elsewhere. This paper was written pre-COVID, but the implications for understanding the implications SARS-CoV-2 related vaccine hesitancy should be pretty obvious.

	- This paper, authored by a recent UM PhD graduate - Nina Masters - who I worked with, goes into some depth about the measurement of spatial clustering of non-medical exemptions (NMEs) to vaccination using school-level data from Michigan. The topic is interesting and important, and the paper also provides a helpful overview and comparison of different clustering metrics as applied to the Michigan NME data.
