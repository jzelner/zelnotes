In the last of our sessions explicitly focused on the relationship between residential segregation and health inequality, we'll dig into the mechanistic relationship between residential segregation and infectious disease transmission. We will also discuss how disease can propel systems of inequality in addition to being impacted by them.

### Before Class
##### Reading
Acevedo-Garcia D. Residential segregation and the epidemiology of infectious diseases. _Social Science & Medicine_. 2000;51(8):1143-1161. doi:[[00|[00)00016-2](00|10.1016/S0277-9536(00|[00)00016-2]]00016-2]]00016-2)00016-2)
- This is a classic paper that digs into the question of what it is that segregation *does* in infectious disease transmission. It has been very influential in my own thinking and comes up a lot in more recent papers in this area that have tried to integrate the ideas here into transmission models or analyses of spatial and social inequality in infection outcomes.

Finn BM, Kobayashi LC. Structural inequality in the time of COVID-19: Urbanization, segregation, and pandemic control in sub-Saharan Africa. _Dialogues in Human Geography_. 2020;10(2):217-220. doi:[10.1177/2043820620934310](https://doi.org/10.1177/2043820620934310)
- This is a great paper by Brandon Finn,  a PhD student in Urban Planning at Harvard, and Lindsay Kobayashi, who is a faculty member in epidemiology at UM. They look at the question of not only how segregation influences infectious disease transmission, but also how prior epidemics and pandemics influenced patterns of racial segregation in South Africa during and after the apartheid era. I am including this because it gets into the cyclical relationship between the social and biological processes underlying spatial infection inequalties, and also because it is helpful for broadening our understanding of these ideas outside of the U.S./N. America.

### During Class

- We will complete a [hands-on activity](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/segregation-transmission/) to help us dig into the ideas about the causal relationships between residential segregation and infectious disease disparities from the Acevedo-Garcia paper.

- This is a great paper that gets at differences in occupation-related mobility and race/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. It is a bit heavier on methodological detail for transmission models, which is why I didn't include it in the main readings. But it is definitely worth a read ifthe topic/approach is of interest to you!
