### Thoughts about readings
- What differentiates the perspective of social epidemiology - at least as defined by Kirby, Dummer & co - from health geography? Do you find this distinction meaningful at all?
- Concept of record linkage, introduced in Kirby, is important for operationalizing the multilevel approach to epidemiology.
- Dummer introduces the notion of ecological fallacy and the potential risks associated with making policy from aggregated data.
