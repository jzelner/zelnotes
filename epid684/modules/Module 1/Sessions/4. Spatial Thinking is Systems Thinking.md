#### Before Class

Please read the following pieces focused on ways of thinking about public health and epidemiology from a systems perspective. Neither is primarily spatial in its focus, but I think you will see the relevance quite clearly:

#### During Class
We will complete a hands-on exercise focused on mapping out the interacting components of the topic you have chosen as the focus of your [[What is the origin?]] project. So please come to class prepared to think through some of these questions with respect to your topic.
