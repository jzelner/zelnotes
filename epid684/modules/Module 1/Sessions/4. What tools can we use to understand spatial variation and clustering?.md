In this session, we will focus in on the problem of how we can use epidemiological data to examine the role of Tobler's first law - the universality of spatial relatedness - as well as Goodchild's revised first law - the ubiquity of spatial variation - in epidemiology data. 

## Before Class

Please read the following two selections. The first is a short article introducing the concept of a disease 'hotspot' and the second is a more in-depth treatment of the idea of disease clustering:

## During Class

During the first half of class, we will discuss the readings and key concepts in them and I will introduce the concept of *kernel smoothing* and its application to epidemiologic data as a tool for visualizing and identifying disease clusters. 

In the second half of class, we will complete a hands-on activity in which we will experiment with smoothing different types of simulated data using this [interactive tutorial](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/smoothing).
