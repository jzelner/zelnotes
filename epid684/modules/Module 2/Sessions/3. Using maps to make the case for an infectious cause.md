In this session, we will finally make our way into Golden Square and its ongoing outbreak, and see how the things Snow had learned from his prior investigations came together in the context of the outbreak unfolding in front of his eyes.Â We will finish our reading and discussion of *The Ghost Map* and complete a hands-on activity in which we can apply some more modern tools of spatial analysis to the Golden Square data.
