Today's theme is focused on taking the ideas from *The Ghost Map* into  the present. We will read three papers that get into direct lessons from the Broad Street Outbreak (Greenhalgh), another that reflects on some of the challenges of making good use of geospatial data in the present day (Koch), and a short opinion piece discussing the relationship between social disparities and spatial analysis (Chowkwanyun & Reed).
