In this module, we will use a historical example - the 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak and John Snow's historic analysis and intervention in it - to explore what it is that makes a public health problem a spatial one. Specifically, we will look at how this particular outbreak was shaped by the confluence of biological and environmental mechanisms. 

### Learning Objectives

**By the end of this module, you will be able to:** 

1.  Explain the multi-level approach to spatial epidemiology. ([[Apply a spatial systems approach to public health.|CG1]],[[Become effective in the application of spatial ideas to real-world problems in epidemiology.|CG2]])
2.  Explain how evidence at different spatial scales was used to argue for the germ theory of Cholera transmission. ([[Apply a spatial systems approach to public health.|CG1]], [[Become effective in the application of spatial ideas to real-world problems in epidemiology.|CG2]]) 
3. Describe how social, environmental and biological mechanisms came together to facilitate the spread of Cholera in 19th century London  ([[Apply a spatial systems approach to public health.|CG1]])
