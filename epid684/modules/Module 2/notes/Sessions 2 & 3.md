- Lectures for both sessions took longer than anticipated, and we didn't get to the smoothing exercise until the the third session of this module.
- In the future, either start the interactive earlier in the module or only include one in this section.
- Down the line, maybe do smoothing as part of Tobler's first law lession in first module?
