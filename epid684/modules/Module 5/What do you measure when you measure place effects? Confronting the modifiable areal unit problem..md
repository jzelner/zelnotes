In this session, we'll dive into the modifiable areal unit problem, an issue that is pretty closely related to the idea of ecologic fallacies: How do the boundaries we choose impact the conclusions that we can - and do - draw? What conceptual tools do we have to mitigate this problem?

#### Before Class
##### Readings

1. This is a bit of a polemical introduction to basic concepts in the definition of neighborhoods and the potential implications of each approach for characterizing health outcomes:

Freedom from the tyranny of neighbourhood: Rethinking sociospatial context effects. _Progress in Human Geography_](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcu54xeoruk8uer/Petrovi%C4%87%20et%20al.%20-%202020%20-%20Freedom%20from%20the%20tyranny%20of%20neighbourhood%20Rethink.pdf?dl=0). 2020;44(6):1103-1123. doi:[10.1177/0309132519868767](https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132519868767)

2. This is a new paper by the same authors looking at the impact of spatial scale on the measurement of neighborhood wealth. This doesn't have a health outcome as the primary focus of the analysis, but instead does a great job of showing how the measurement of a key input to many spatial/social models in epidemiology - neighborhood socioeconomic status - is impacted by the scale we choose to look at it:
