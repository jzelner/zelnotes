#### Before Class
The readings for this session are focused on the collection and use of mobile phone mobility data to inform analyses of infectious disease transmission. We will look specifically at the example of mobile phones as tools to potentially track the COVID-19 pandemic, since this is an area in which these data have repeatedly been applied (and mis-applied)! But the use of this sort of information is likely only to accelerate in the coming years, so our discussion of this in the context of COVID-19 is really a springboard into thinking about the relevance of this approach for future outbreaks of infectious and non-communicable diseases.

##### Readings

1. This is a paper from early in the pandemic that gives an overview of how such data *might* be used to inform analyses of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It gets into the strengths and limitations of mobile phone mobility data as identified from previous analyses of pathogens such as malaria:

2. This analysis uses information on mobility to characterize the relationship between patterns of movement and neighborhood-level disadvantage and the relationship of both to spatial variation in SARS-CoV-2 incidence:
