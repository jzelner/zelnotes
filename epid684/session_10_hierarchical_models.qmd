# Introduction to hierarchical models for multi-level variation

## Before Class

### Reading

Read @gelman2006 [ðŸ“„](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szyaxp5f49gi8sq/gelman_2006_multilevel_%28hierarchical%29_modeling.pdf?dl=0), which is a worked example of a multi-level model of variation in household radon intensity, which is an important environmental exposure.

Read @demaio2017 [ðŸ“„](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h83r64zas685gkt/De%20Maio%20et%20al.%20-%202017%20-%20Racialethnic%20minority%20segregation%20and%20low%20birth%20w.pdf?dl=0), which is a simple but interesting look at within- and between-city variation in low-birthweight outcomes in the U.S. and Canada.

### During Class

- Discussion of the Gelman and DeMaio papers and hierarchical regresion approaches.

- Hands-on with some simulated multi-level data and models.
