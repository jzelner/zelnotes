# Introduction to hierarchical models for multi-level variation

## Before Class

### Reading

Read @gelman2006 [ðŸ“„](https://www.dropbox.com/s/szyaxp5f49gi8sq/gelman_2006_multilevel_%28hierarchical%29_modeling.pdf?dl=0), which is a worked example of a multi-level model of variation in household radon intensity, which is an important environmental exposure

## During Class

- Discussion of the Gelman paper and hierarchical regression models more generally.
