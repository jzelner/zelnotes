American Journal of Epidemiology. 2017;186(6):627-635. [doi:10.1093/aje/kwx261](https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx261)\n\n### Preparation for in-class activity\n\nIn class, we will be doing a walk-through of how to reproduce the analysis in the radon paper we reviewed in a [previous class session](session_10_hierarchical_models.qmd). To be able to run this, please come to class with your computer set up to run the example:\n\n1. **Install or update to the latest version of RStudio.** The tutorial code will be contained in a Quarto markdown document. Quarto is an updated version of the venerable RMarkdown, and the [newest versions of RStudio include Quarto support by default](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html). \n\n2. **Set up your R/RStudio installation to be able to load the following packages using the following code**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(rstanarm)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you are not sure if you have these installed or want to update to the latest versions, please paste this command into a running R session to download and install:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggplot2\",\"tidyr\",\"dplyr\",\"bayesplot\",\"rstanarm\",\"purrr\",\"tidybayes\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you run into problems with any of these, please let me know!",
