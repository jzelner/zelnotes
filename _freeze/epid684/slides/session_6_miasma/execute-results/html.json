Why was miasma a compelling explanation for outbreaks of Cholera in South London?\n\n2. What aspects of Snow's life made him an ideal investigator of the cause of Cholera?\n\n3. What are some  <span class=\"alert\">modern parallels</span> to the strong hold that miasma theory had on 19th century Londoners? \n\n4. How did Snow start to use evidence at different spatial scales to push back against the miasmatists?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_796cc77f\" data-warn-when=\"60\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">05</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## {data-background-image=\"/images/snow_map.png\"}\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size: 3em; color: white; -webkit-text-stroke:2px black\">Snow's Road to the 1854 Outbreak</h1>\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"/images/elbe_arrival.png\" width=\"400\">\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"/images/elbe_blenkinsopp.png\">\n\n## Rewind to 1848\n\n<img src=\"/images/elbe_spread.png\">\n\n## I smell a rat üêÄ...\n\n> \"[I]t was stretching matters beyond belief to suggest that the room should suddenly become prone to those poisonous vapors the very day it was occupied by a sailor traveling from a city beseiged by the disease.\"\n\n## In Snow's words\n\n> \"Who can doubt that the case of John Harnold...was the true cause of the malady in Blenkinsopp...And if cholera be communicated in some instances, is there not the strongest possibility that it is so in the others - in short, that <span class=\"alert\">similar effects depend on similar causes<span>.\"\n\n\n## What happened in the 1849 <span class=\"alert\">Thomas street outbreak</span> that drove these ideas home for Snow?\n\n:::{.fragment}\n> \"Whether you looked at the evidence on the scale of an urban courtyard or on the scale of entire city neighborhoods, the same pattern repeated itself: the cholera seemed to segment itself around shared water supplies. <span class=\"alert\">If the miasma theory were right, why would it draw such arbitrary distinctions?</span> Why would the cholera devastate one building but leave the one next door unscathed?
