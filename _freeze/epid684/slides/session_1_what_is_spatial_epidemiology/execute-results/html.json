Become effective in the application of spatial ideas to real-world problems in epidemiology.\n\n2. Be able to apply a spatial systems approach to public health.\n\n3. Learn how to select appropriate quantitative tools for addressing spatial public health problems.\n\n4. Understand how to use spatial analysis as a tool for advancing <span class=\"alert\">health justice</span> and <span class=\"alert\">equity</span>.\n\n\n## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ: The final (epidemiological) frontier?\n\n![What makes spatial thinking and analysis different from non-spatial approaches?](/images/uss_enterprise.jpg)\n\n\n## Maps are an <span class=\"alert\">entrypoint</span> to spatial analysis \n\n![John Snow's famous 1854 map of Cholera deaths around the Broad Street Pump in London](/images/snow_cholera_map.jpg)\n\n\n## Spatial epidemiology snuck up on me...\n\n![](/images/lima_tb_incidence.png)\n\n\n## What makes an epidemiological problem <span class=\"alert\">meaningfully</span> spatial?\n\n<span class=\"alert\">Spend a few minutes answering the questions in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X3EmUPFAsaaq0_DMhFrV0FDKM-RxKQjks8pMEZ0tpu4/edit?usp=sharing):</span> \n\n- What do you think the <span class=\"alert\">value</span> of spatial analysis is for you in your academic or professional role (e.g. epidemiologist)?\n\n- What topics or methods are you most interested in learning about?\n\n- Any üî• burning questions üî• about the topic or class that I can answer? \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"countdown\" id=\"timer_cf27da56\" data-warn-when=\"60\" data-update-every=\"1\" tabindex=\"0\" style=\"right:0;bottom:0;\">\n<div class=\"countdown-controls\"><button class=\"countdown-bump-down\">&minus;</button><button class=\"countdown-bump-up\">&plus;</button></div>\n<code class=\"countdown-time\"><span class=\"countdown-digits minutes\">05</span><span class=\"countdown-digits colon\">:</span><span class=\"countdown-digits seconds\">00</span></code>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## My take: <span class=\"alert\">Relationships</span> are at the heart of spatial analysis\n\n- <span class=\"alert\">Distance</span> is a stand-in for all the things that often make near things more similar and far things less similar.\n\n- For example: environmental exposures, social and political factors, patterns of movement, built environment.\n\n- Shares a lot of ideas with longitudinal and network analysis.\n\n- Necessarily highly <span class=\"alert\">interdisciplinary</span> and open to a wide range of approaches.\n\n## Spatial relationships are often physical reflections of social ones\n\n![Relationships between education, racial privilege and consistently low COVID-19 vaccination rates in Philadelphia neighborhoods. From @rich2022](/images/rich_vaccination_segregation_philly.png)\n\n## Our key focus in this class is on how spatialized <span class=\"alert\">processes</span> generate spatial patterns\n\n![Flow diagram of relationship between residential segregation and infection from @zelner2022](/images/vulnerability_racism_flow.png)\n\n\n## That's great, but what are we actually going to *do* this term?\n\n- [Syllabus](https://zelnotes.io/teaching/EPID684/Winter+2023+Syllabus)\n\n## Next Time\n\n- Digging into some of the [key ideas and tools of spatial epidemiology](https://publish.obsidian.md/epibayes/Courses/EPID684/modules/Module+1/Sessions/2.+Maps+and+More) in more detail.\n\n# References\n",
