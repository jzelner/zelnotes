(from Lichter & Parisi [@lichter2015])](/images/lichter_low_macro.png)\n\n## This requires dealing with both micro- and <span class=\"alert\">macro-level</span> segregation at the same time\n\n![A pattern of segregation dominated by between-unit variation [@lichter2015]](/images/lichter_high_macro.png)\n\n## Can classic metrics of segregation capture <span class=\"alert\">hierarchical</span> variation?\n\n- Dissimilarity & Isolation only characterize variation *within* the lowest levels observed.\n\n- Moran's I includes information on *proximity* or *adjacency* but is also only focused on lowest-level relationships.\n\n- Lichter and Parisi [@lichter2015] use the Thiel index - an <span class=\"alert\">entropy</span>-based measure - to characterize the overall intensity and scale of residential segregation.\n\n## What is <span class=\"alert\">entropy</span>?\n\n:::{.columns}\n\n:::{.column width=50%}\n- Entropy ($E$) is a measure of <span class=\"alert\">uncertainty</span> \n\n- Maximum value <span class=\"alert\">$\\to$</span> Maximum Uncertainty\n\n- Minimum value <span class=\"alert\"></span> Minimum Uncertainty\n- For two groups: $$E = p \\frac{1}{p} + (1-p)\\frac{1}{1-p}$$\n\n- Not limited to <span class=\"alert\">binary</span> comparisons\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=50%}\n:::{.fragment}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nrequire(ggplot2)\np <- seq(from=0.01, to=1, by = 0.01)\nE <- p*log(1/p) + (1-p)*log(1/(1-p))\ndf <- data.frame(p=p,E=E)\ng <- ggplot(df, aes(x=p,y=E)) + \ngeom_point() +\nxlab(\"Proportion in group\") + \nylab(\"Entropy\") + \ngeom_vline(xintercept = 0.5)\nplot(g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Entropy as a function of the proportion of individuals in a group, p](session_24_multidimensional_segregation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## <span class=\"alert\">Thiel</span> index ($H$)\n\n:::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=50%}\n- A <span class=\"alert\">weighted average</span> of differences in <span class=\"alert\">entropy</span> between different levels.\n\n- If $H=0$, the entropy within all lower-level units is equivalent to the population-level entropy. \n\n- In other words, all variation is <span class=\"alert\">within-unit</span>.\n\n- If $H=1$, the total amount of population-level entropy is explained by <span class=\"alert\">between-unit</span> variation.\n:::\n\n:::{.column width=50%}\n:::{.fragment}\n$$\nH_{B \\in M} = \\frac{1}{N_M E_M} \\sum_{b=1}^{B}N_B(E_M-E_b) \n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $N_M$ is the total population \n- $E_M$ is the entropy for the whole population\n- $N_b$ is the population of small area $b$ \n- $E_b$ is the entropy of small area $b$\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## What does it mean for $H$ to be <span class=\"alert\">decomposable</span>?\n\n- $H$ is a sum over neighborhood-level differences from the population entropy.\n\n- To see what the contribution of a given <span class=\"alert\">level</span> is to the overall H, we just look at the sum over all smallest-level units in the one we care about.\n\n- This lets us ask what proportion of the total $H$ in an area can be attributed to variation <span class=\"alert\">within</span> and <span class=\"alert\">between</span> different types of units within a metro area.\n\n## Let's compare the <span class=\"alert\">Theil</span> approach to the others\n\n![](/images/cluster_measures_hands_on.png)\n\n[Hands-on!](https://sph-umich.shinyapps.io/spatial_segregation/)\n\n## So, what can we <span class=\"alert\">learn</span> from this?\n\n![](/images/lichter_macro_segregation_table.png)\n\n## Different groups $\\to$ different <span class=\"alert\">patterns</span>\n\n![](/images/lichter_asian_white.png)\n\n:::{.fragment}\n![Any concerns about the comparison being made?](/images/lichter_hispanic_white.png)\n:::\n\n## Do the hierarchical and <span style=\"color:#add8e6\">ICE</span> approaches help us with the <span class=\"alert\">tyrrany of neighborhoods</span>? {.imgslide}\n\n![](/images/petrovic_neighborhood_scales.png)\nCan theses approaches help us pick more relevant scales of analysis?
