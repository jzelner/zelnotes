The topics we focus on in our in-class sessions are selected to support your own work on the semester-long [Roadmap Project](roadmap-project/index.qmd)\n\nThis semester, we will meet in SPH I 2695 from 1:30-2:50pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays, beginning 1/5. If you are unable to attend class in-person, please use this [zoom link](https://umich.zoom.us/j/99504833290) to participate remotely.\n\nPlease review the [course policies](policies.qmd) for information about attendance, grading and other issues.\n\n## Laying the Foundations: What is spatial epidemiology?\n\nIn this first module, we will start to get our heads around what we actually mean when we talk about spatial epidemiology. First and foremost, we'll ask the question of *why* space matters in public health, *when* it does and does not, and what tools are available to us to diagnose and address spatial problems where they exist.\n\n \n|Date | Topic |\n|---------|:----------|\n| 01/05 (Thu) | [Where are we going?](class_1_where%20are%20we%20going.qmd) |\n| 01/10 (Tue) | [Maps and More](class_2_maps_and_more.qmd) |\n| 01/12 (Thu)| [Spatial epidemiology is all about relationships ](class_4_spatial_variation.qmd) |\n| 01/17 (Tue) | [What tools can we use to understand spatial variation and clustering?](class_4_spatial_variation.qmd)|\n\n\n## Spatial analysis and the foundations of modern epidemiology\n\nIn this module, we will use an important but often-mischaracterized historical example - the 1854 Broad Street Cholera outbreak and John Snow's historic analysis and intervention in it - to explore what it is that makes a public health problem a spatial one. Specifically, we will look at how this particular outbreak was shaped by the confluence of biological, social, and environmental mechanisms. \n\nAnother important component of this story is one of problem definition: Is the problem transmission of an infectious pathogen, or the spatial aggregation of foul-smelling, disease-causing air? \n\nDuring this module, we will use Snow's challenges in convincing a skeptical public and medical establishment of the infectious etiology of Cholera as a springboard for the type of problem definition that is the focus of the [Postcards from the Road](roadmap-project/assignment-postcard.qmd) assignment. This will culminate in presentations at the end of this module, and we will use some of the class time prior to these presentations to make progress on this project.\n\n|Date | Topic |\n|---------|:----------|\n| 01/19 (Thu) | [Walking into a Cholera epidemic](class_5_walking_into_a_cholera_epidemic.qmd) |\n| 01/24 (Tue) | [Miasma vs. Germ Theory](session_6_miasma.qmd) |\n|01/26 (Thu) | Using maps to make the case |\n|| [What is the origin?](roadmap-project/assignment-origin.qmd) assignment due | \n| 01/31 (Tue) | From the pump handle to the present |\n| 02/02 (Thu) | Hands-on: Mapping the Snow data | \n  \n\n## Project Progress\n\n|Date | Topic |\n|---------|:----------|\n| 02/07 (Tue) | In-class project work time & check-in|\n|02/09 (Thu) | In-class presentation of [What is the destination?](roadmap-project/assignment-destination.qmd) assignments.|\n| 02/14 (Tue) | In-class presentation of What is the destination? assignments (cont'd)|\n\n## Spatial clustering of health as a problem of intersecting social, biological, and environmental systems \n\n|Date|Topic|\n|---------|:----------|\n|02/16 (Thu)| What is clustering and why should you care?| \n|02/21 (Tue)| Residential Segregation and the Social Drivers of Clustered Risk |\n| 02/23 (Thu) | TBD |\n|02/24 (Fri)| Mid-term Check-in due|\n|02/28 (Tue)| Winter Break (no class) |\n|03/02 (Thu)| Winter Break (no class) |\n|03/07 (Tue)| Relating Residential Segregation to Disease Outcomes |\n|03/09 (Thu)| How do we capture the causal impact of structural racism on spatial outcomes? |   \n|03/14 (Tue)| Mechanistic linkages between structural racism and infectious disease |\n|03/16 (Thu)| Public health implications of spatially-clustered non-vaccination |\n\n## Multi-level approaches to spatial analysis and intervention\n\n|Date|Topic|\n|----|:----|\n|03/21 (Tue)| Comparing between-place and between-individual variation using intraclass correlation|\n|03/23 (Thu)| TBD|\n|03/28 (Tue)| Digging into the multi-level approach to spatial analysis |\n|03/30 (Thu)| In-class workshop on [Postcard from the road assignments](roadmap-project/assignment-postcard.qmd) |\n|04/04 (Tue)| Applications of the multi-level approach to spatial health data |\n\n## Working across scales to capture individual and contextual effects on health \n|Date|Topic|\n|----|:---|\n|04/06 (Thu)| What do you measure when you measure place effects?
