Before class, please:\n\n1. **Install or update to the latest version of RStudio.** The tutorial code will be contained in a Quarto markdown document. Quarto is an updated version of the venerable RMarkdown, and the [newest versions of RStudio include Quarto support by default](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/rstudio.html). \n\nBefore or at the beginning of class:\n\n2. **Set up your R/RStudio installation to be able to load the following packages using the following code**:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\nlibrary(rstanarm)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidybayes)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you are not sure if you have these installed or want to update to the latest versions, please paste this command into a running R session to download and install:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggplot2\",\"tidyr\",\"dplyr\",\"bayesplot\",\"rstanarm\",\"purrr\",\"tidybayes\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you run into problems with any of these, please let me know!\n\n## During Class\n\n- [Slide](slides/session_2_multilevel) \n\n- You can find the tutorial we are going to work through [here](/posts/radon/index.qmd)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [Zoom recording](https://umich.zoom.us/rec/share/6gH1aHW5O3cqnRVVKu-gt4jJ0cfF6_k3DfYCiFazFig7_1Jm3H3BDvJxBCALO4W9.irqxQcDhJEkDgDIx?startTime=1677024348000)",
